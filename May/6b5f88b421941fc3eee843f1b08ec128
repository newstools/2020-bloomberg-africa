Sign up to our Next Africa newsletter and  follow Bloomberg Africa on Twitter Zimbabwe’s second-largest city, Bulawayo, has implemented new measures limiting water supply to one day per week, the most stringent measures yet to conserve dwindling resources. Water cuts will now last 144 hours a week, an increase from the 120 hours announced last month, in response to the city decommissioning its third reservoir on Friday, town clerk Christopher Dube said in an emailed statement. The city has six supply reservoirs and two of these had already been put out of service due to low water levels. “In order to avoid the system from collapsing due to the supply-demand deficit, a more stringent water-supply regime of 144 hours will be introduced,” said Dube. The combined levels of Bulawayo’s reservoirs on May 14 was 29.9% and their daily supply was unable to meet demand in the city with an official population of at least 650,000, according to a 2012 census.
