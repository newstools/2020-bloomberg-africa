As the military actions, the “result of the Azerbaijan-Turkish military aggression,” are approaching Armenia’s borders, Pashinyan wrote to Putin to request talks on help Russia could provide to the nation based on a treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance signed in 1997. This is the first time Armenia has formally asked Russia for talks about aid under the mutual defense pact. Russia will provide Yerevan with all the necessary assistance in accordance with the treaty if the clashes cross into Armenian territory, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Saturday, referring to Pashinyan’s letter. Still, Russia urged both parties to stick to a cease-fire accord and negotiate in line with a plan reached on Oct. 10. Armenia reported “intense” fighting Friday as Azerbaijan forces closed in on a key strategic city of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenia accused Azerbaijan of using phosphorous weapons on Saturday, according to the Twitter account of Armenia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anna Naghdalyan. Azerbaijan rejected the allegations, saying Armenia was involved in shipping phosphorous, according to an Interfax report, citing a statement from Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry.
