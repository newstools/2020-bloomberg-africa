The recommended changes will be put to voters in a referendum that’s expected to take place before the country holds elections in 2022, President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a televised address in the capital, Nairobi. The proposals, outlined in November, were published for the first time on Wednesday. “There are recommendations about inclusivity and about dealing and doing away with divisive elections,” Kenyatta said. Kenyan has struggled to put an end to election-related ethnic violence that have marred previous votes, including in 2007 when more than 1,100 people died. The candidate who wins the support of three of the five biggest ethnic groups -- Kenyatta’s Kikuyu, Deputy President William Ruto’s Kalenjin, opposition leader Raila Odinga’s Luo, the Luhya and the Kamba -- is almost guaranteed to win the presidency. The members of the panel were chosen by Kenyatta and Odinga, who opposed each other in the last election in 2017.
