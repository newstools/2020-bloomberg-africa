BlackRock Inc. says that the scale of restructuring needs globally could exceed the previous peak that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. “One big reason is the significant growth in sub-investment grade debt,” the company’s research arm, BlackRock Investment Institute, said in a note dated Oct. 19.

Firms will likely have to evolve their business models amid the pandemic, and BlackRock sees a “wave of restructurings” and room for private credit to cater to smaller borrowers.
