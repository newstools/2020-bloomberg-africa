President Nicolas Maduro said Venezuelan scientists have isolated a molecule that inhibits the Covid-19 virus and will ask the World Health Organization to evaluate its possible use on a global scale. The active ingredient is a derivative of ursolic acid from a plant and non-toxic to humans, Maduro said in an appearance on state television Sunday. Six months of research at the government-backed IVIC scientific institute led to the discovery, he said. “The molecule will be mass-produced and delivered worldwide for the cure of Covid-19,” according to Maduro. Ursolic acid is sold in the U.S. as a dietary supplement with reputed anti-inflammatory properties.
