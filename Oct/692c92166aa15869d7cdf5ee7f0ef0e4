South African inflation slowed for the second straight month in September, to the bottom of the central bank’s target range. Consumer prices rose 3% from a year earlier, compared with 3.1% in August, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said Wednesday in a statement on its website. It matched the median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Prices rose 0.2% in the month, in line with a median estimate of nine economists. — With assistance by Simbarashe Gumbo
