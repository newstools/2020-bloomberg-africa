South Africa’s main stock index rises 0.3% in early Johannesburg trading, as index giant Richemont advances, and as MultiChoice Group soars. MultiChoice gains as much as 9.2%, the biggest intraday jump since June 10, after the company announced that France’s Groupe Canal+ SA had acquired a 6.5% stake. Monday’s increase extends MultiChoice’s winning streak to nine days, the longest on record. South Africa joins markets in Europe and Asia in rising Monday as traders react to the possibility of President Donald Trump being able to leave hospital as soon as Monday after treatment for Covid-19. But Trump’s condition remains clouded by confusion, with the president’s effort to show strength contradicted by conflicting accounts from his doctors. NEWS:
