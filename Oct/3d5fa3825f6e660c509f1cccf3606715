Family members of the 157 people who died in the crash of a Boeing Co. 737 Max in Ethiopia are demanding more records from U.S. safety agencies, according to a pair of letters sent on the second anniversary of another accident involving the plane. A letter to the National Transportation Safety Board, which assisted in the investigation of both crashes, accused the agency of an “unreasonable pro-secrecy stance.” A second letter to the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration also demanded more documentation, saying “public trust in the FAA needs to be repaired with more than just assurances.” The letters, which were signed by dozens of relatives and acquaintances of the dead, are part of a lawsuit filed on behalf of the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, 2019. The NTSB has said in correspondence that the work it’s conducting in the investigations isn’t complete, so it can’t release the information under its guidelines. The safety board didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours. The FAA traditionally doesn’t provide information it considers proprietary. The agency said in a statement on Thursday night that it planned to respond directly to the families. A total of 346 people died in the two crashes, a Lion Air jetliner that went down in the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia on Sept. 29, 2018, and the Ethiopian Airlines plane that plummeted shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa on March 10, 2019.
