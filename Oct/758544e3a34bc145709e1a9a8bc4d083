Maintaining Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region takes precedence over other considerations, Cohen said in an Army Radio interview. Qatar has ruled out normalizing ties with Israel before its conflict with the Palestinians is resolved. Qatar Formally Requests to Buy F-35 Jets: Reuters The United Arab Emirates, which signed a U.S.-brokered normalization pact with Israel in September, has similarly asked to buy America’s most sophisticated warplane. The Trump administration is expected to submit the request to Congress, where it is likely to generate some tough questioning about how it affects Israel. Cohen added that other countries he didn’t identify have put in confidential requests to purchase the jets.
