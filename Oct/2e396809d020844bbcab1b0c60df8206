A court in Mali handed the death sentence to a Mauritanian member who planned terror attacks on a luxury hotel and a restaurant, marking the country’s first conviction of a high-profile al-Qaeda militant, Agence France-Presse reported Wednesday. Fawaz Ould Ahmeida, who admitted to the crimes, led a group of militants who in 2015 stormed the Radisson Blu Hotel in the capital, Bamako, taking 170 people hostage. A Russian flight crew, three Chinese executives, an American aid worker and hotel staff were among 22 people who died in the siege. Ahmeida told the court he planned the hotel siege as well as an attack eight months earlier on La Terrasse, a restaurant popular with foreigners, as revenge for the publication of cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed in the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, according to AFP. Ahmeida was at the time a member of al-Murabitoun, a jihadist group led by al-Qaeda commander Mokhtar Belmokhtar. One of his Ahmeida’s Malian accomplices received the same sentence. Under Malian law, death sentences are converted to life in jail. The attacks were the first to strike the heart of the capital and ushered in a string of similar high-profile raids in West Africa. In 2016, al-Qaeda militants killed at least 26 people in a hotel in Burkina Faso’s main city of Ouagadougou. A few months later, fighters descended on a popular beach resort in Ivory Coast, killing 22 people.
