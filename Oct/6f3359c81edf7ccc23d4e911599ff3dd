Malaysia recorded the biggest single-day increase in new coronavirus cases since the outbreak began as authorities consider whether it needs to bring back movement limits to curb infections. The country reported 287 new coronavirus cases on Friday, all of which were found in the country and not among travelers from overseas, according to the Health Ministry. The state of Kedah reported the highest number of infections at 129, followed by Sabah with 113 and Selangor, which neighbors the capital Kuala Lumpur, at 31. Malaysia remains in the recovery phase of its movement restriction policy, with the government continuing to monitor the virus situation to decide on any necessary restrictions, Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah told a briefing. It was only on June 10 that the country allowed nearly all activities to resume, after letting most economic sectors to reopen on May 4. The government extended the current phase of the lockdown until the end of the year, with the country still keeping its international borders shut and restricting overseas travel. The increase on Friday exceeded the previous high of 277 on June 4. While the spike in June was mostly concentrated in detention centers, the current resurgence is linked to various gatherings, which makes it more difficult to track and contain, Noor Hisham said. “We advise people to avoid large gatherings, and if such gatherings can’t be avoided then to ensure the health guidelines are followed,” he said. Many of the new cases were found in Sabah or could be linked to travelers from the Borneo state, which is forming a new government after holding a state election last Saturday. — With assistance by Yantoultra Ngui
