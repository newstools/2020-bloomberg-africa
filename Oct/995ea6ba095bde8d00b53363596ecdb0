The University of Oxford will trial a new testing technology that aims to identify asymptomatic individuals with the coronavirus. Trials of the technology will go ahead over the next few weeks across the U.K., according to an announcement Thursday. It is expected the test will produce results within minutes. Some staff and students of the university will be offered tests as part of the study and will be trained in how to process and record results using the U.K.’s test-and-trace application. Oxford, which is also working on a potential vaccine with AstraZeneca Plc, is developing the pilot test program in partnership with the U.K.’s Department of Health, Public Health England and Durham University.
