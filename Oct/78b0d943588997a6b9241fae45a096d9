Cooperation with international partners in Mali, including the French-counter terrorism force Barkhane and the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the region, will continue, J. Peter Pham told reporters on a conference call Wednesday. The U.S. suspended all cooperation with Mali’s military after the overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita by army officers on Aug. 18. The nation’s junta last month appointed a retired army officer as transitional president to lead the nation until elections take place in 18 months. Separately, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Wednesday he will travel to Mali “soon” to meet the new leaders and discuss the transition process. — With assistance by Rudy Ruitenberg
