At least 13 people were killed and more than 50 others were injured in a missile attack on Azerbaijan’s second-largest city of Ganca overnight, the authorities in Baku said. A residential building was shelled around 1 a.m., the Azerbaijani Prosecutor General’s Office said on its website. Search and rescue efforts continued after 13 bodies were pulled from the rubble and two children were still missing. Armenia’s Defense Ministry denied firing any missiles toward Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev blamed Armenia for the attack in a televised address and reiterated that fighting will continue until Armenia agrees to withdraw its forces from Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized territory. “No one can stop us,” he said. Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides since the worst fighting in decades erupted between Armenians and Azerbaijan over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh three weeks ago. Fighting continued overnight and in the morning of Saturday despite a cease-fire brokered by Russia on Oct. 10. #Armenia’s another heinous missile attack on #Ganja city of #Azerbaijan. 12 civilians killed, including 2 minors, more than 40 seriously injured.
