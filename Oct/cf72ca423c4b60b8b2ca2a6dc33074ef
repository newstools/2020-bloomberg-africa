South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa is in self-quarantine after a guest at a dinner he attended on Saturday tested positive for the coronavirus. Ramaphosa is “showing no symptoms” of coronavirus infection and will be tested if he presents any signs, the presidency said in a statement posted on Twitter on Wednesday.

The rand declined in the wake of the announcement after trading little changed earlier. The South African currency slipped as much as 0.4% to 16.2669 to the dollar before trading at 16.2650 at 09:25 a.m. in Johannesburg.
