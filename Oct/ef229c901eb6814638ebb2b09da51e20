Nigerian Police fire teargas at people during clashes between youths following ongoing demonstrations in Apo, Abuja, Nigeria, on Oct. 20. At least 56 people have died in Nigeria in two weeks of protests against police brutality, with 38 of them killed on Tuesday alone as the government began a crackdown, human rights group Amnesty International said. “Victims include protesters and thugs who were allegedly hired by the authorities to confront the protesters,” Isa Sanusi, a spokesman for the group in Nigeria, said in an emailed statement. “In many cases the security forces had used excessive force in an attempt to control or stop the protests.”
