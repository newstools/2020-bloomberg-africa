British farmers were pummeled by a season of weather extremes, as record winter downpours cut plantings before spring dry spells then hurt young crops. That means the wheat harvest will probably slump 38% to 10.1 million tons, the smallest in data going back to 1984, the government said on Monday. The shrinking supply means Britain will need to import more to meet demand just as the transition period to depart the European Union expires at the end of the year. Purchases from the bloc -- typically the top supplier -- could be subject to steep tariffs without a trade deal, and there’s the risk of chaos at ports as goods being imported without the right paperwork are turned back.
