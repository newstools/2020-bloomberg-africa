Annual consumer inflation slowed to 10.4% from 10.5% reported for August, Samuel Kobina Annim, government statistician, told reporters Wednesday in Accra, the capital. The median estimate of three economists in a Bloomberg survey was 10.5%. Prices fell 0.2% in the month, the first monthly decline in a year. — With assistance by Simbarashe Gumbo
