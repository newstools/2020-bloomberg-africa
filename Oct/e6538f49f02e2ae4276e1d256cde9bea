Visas will again be available to visitors from France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Hong Kong, Iran and the U.S., the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement on Sunday. International travelers will need to present a negative Covid-19 test result that’s no more than 72 hours old or face a mandatory 10-day quarantine, the government said. The exemptions, coming just days after the reopening of borders to travelers from other African nations, represent another easing of the lockdown in a bid to reboot economic growth clobbered by the pandemic. Coronavirus infections continue to decline in South Africa even as the economy reopens.
