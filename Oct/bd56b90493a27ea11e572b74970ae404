Roche Holding AG’s third-quarter sales fell short of estimates as a boost from Covid-19 tests and new medicines weren’t enough to offset a decline from aging prescription drugs. The Swiss drugmaker’s revenue rose 1% to 14.7 billion francs ($16.1 billion), the company said. Analysts expected sales of 15.4 billion francs, according to the average of eight estimates. The stock dropped as much as 2% in Zurich trading. Roche has forged partnerships and used its diagnostics unit to get into the market for tests and potential treatments for Covid-19, helping it counteract a more challenging environment for its older medicines. These medicines face competition from cheaper copies called biosimilars even as some patients delay doctor’s visits on pandemic concerns.

(Source: Bloomberg) “It was another tough three months for Roche,” Wimal Kapadia, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note. The sales drop for a trio of key older drugs accelerated last quarter. Revenue from breast cancer drug Herceptin plummeted 38%. Sales from Avastin and Rituxan, treatments for cancer and arthritis, respectively, sank by about one-third. The antibody cocktail Roche is developing with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. to treat Covid-19 may start delivering soon after the U.S. company asked regulators there to authorize it for emergency use earlier this month. President Donald Trump took the experimental drug under a compassionate use program after becoming sick with the coronavirus. The company said pharmaceuticals sales will probably recover in the fourth quarter.
