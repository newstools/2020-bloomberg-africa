Pope Francis called for civil unions for gay couples, saying homosexuals should have the right to be part of a family. “They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it,” Pope Francis is quoted as saying in a new documentary. “What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.” A departure from the position of his predecessors, the comments are likely to spark controversy among Catholics. The pontiff discussed same-sex civil unions during an interview with filmmaker Evgeny Afineevsky for his documentary “Francesco” that premiered in Rome on Oct. 21. Before being elected pope, Francis served as archbishop of Buenos Aires, and in that role, he advocated for same-sex civil unions in an attempt to block a same-sex marriage law. However, he had never come out publicly in favor of civil unions as pope. The documentary chronicles Pope Francis’s approach to pressing social issues, and to pastoral ministry among those who live, in the words of the pontiff, “on the existential peripheries.”
