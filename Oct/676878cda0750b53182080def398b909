France may be willing to compromise on how much access its fishermen get to British waters after Brexit, a topic that has threatened to deadlock trade negotiations between the European Union and the U.K. The French government has suggested to the fishing industry that compromises will need to be made, according to a lawmaker in Paris, who asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. However, as negotiations over the wider trade deal intensify, France’s position is fundamentally unchanged, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Despite having only minimal economic significance, the issue of fishing risks derailing a U.K.-EU agreement because of the political ramifications for both sides. French boats have fished in British waters for centuries and the industry relies on the catches they make there. “Fishing is a major sector for some regions” of France, Europe Minister Clement Beaune said on Twitter. “Moral, territorial and economic issues are at stake.” While an EU member, the U.K. was bound by the Common Fisheries Policy, which divvied up its waters among European countries down historical lines. The EU’s hard-line position, designed by France, is that the status quo should remain when the U.K. leaves the European system on Dec. 31. But French President Emmanuel Macron has acknowledged his country’s industry will have to change and his officials signaled he is willing to compromise. The government asked its fisheries industry what concessions would be acceptable to them, Reuters reported on Friday. Macron’s office didn’t return calls for comment. “Fishing is used by the U.K. in a tactical way,” Macron told reporters at an EU summit in Brussels earlier this month. “If there’s a no deal, this is the only topic where Boris Johnson can say ‘I won.’” Negotiations on a trade deal resumed in London on Thursday with both sides aiming for an agreement in about three weeks.
