Biden plans to travel to Warm Springs and Atlanta, according to his campaign, as Democrats focus on flipping a state that’s been trending in their direction. The former vice president will speak “on bringing Americans together to address the crises facing our nation,” his campaign said. President Donald Trump won Georgia by five percentage points in 2016, but Democrats have made inroads in the state, particularly among white, college educated voters. The RealClearPolitics average of state polls has Trump and Biden tied. Democrats are also hoping to win the two Senate races in the state, with Jon Ossoff running even with Senator David Perdue at 43% in a recent New York Times poll. The other race is a special election that is likely headed to a runoff in January as a candidate needs to clear 50% to win. But the Times poll found Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, leading the other candidates, including Republican incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris campaigned in Georgia on Friday and Jill Biden is scheduled to visit on Monday.
