Today we are launching Bloomberg Wealth to help you manage your finances, live your best life and navigate your path to prosperity. That sentiment may seem to sit at odds with the bleakness of this year, but we believe these volatile times make our mission more necessary. The Covid-19 crisis has left millions of people feeling insecure over their personal finances, bringing to the fore questions around where to live, how to work, what to study and how to prepare for the future. We are seeing surging interest — especially among young people — in stock investing, which comes with inherent opportunities and risks. Bloomberg Wealth will draw on the expertise and experience of 2,700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries to bring you insights on investing, taxes, savings and retirement. It will also show how money is shaping the way all of us live and reinvent ourselves in today’s world. In addition, a roster of columnists will offer expert opinion on a range of topics. Our proposition is to point you toward answers to your key questions. To that end, we spoke to a new generation of personal finance experts, and created a guide on the boom in stock trading that will keep you updated with the most important news and views on the topic. Bloomberg Wealth will offer additional guides on topics as varied as buying art, fractional shares and personal bankruptcy. We’ve also written about young Americans taking road trips and the choice of where to live during the pandemic. We will continue to offer features and news across platforms from Businessweek magazine and video to live events. In coming months, we will unveil data-based tools to help you assess your financial health. You can keep track of our coverage and get more information by signing up for our weekly newsletter. We look forward to joining you as you take the next steps in your financial life, and hope you will let us become a trusted partner in your journey.
