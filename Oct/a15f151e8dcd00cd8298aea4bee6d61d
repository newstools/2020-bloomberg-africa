President Donald Trump is heading to hospital on doctor recommendations for a few days. A financial backer of the president’s criticized his attendance at a fundraiser Thursday. Trump’s campaign events will go virtual or will be delayed. Trump said early Friday that he had tested positive along with his wife and one of his closest aides, throwing his campaign into deeper disarray just one month before the election. Other developments: Trump will be taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday for a few days on doctor recommendations, the White House said. Trump will work from offices at Walter Reed, and remains in good spirits with mild symptoms, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. Trump has been treated with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. drugs, the White House physician said earlier. “As a precautionary measure he received a single 8 gram dose of Regenerons’s polyclonal antibody cocktail,” the physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement released by the White House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joined her fellow stimulus negotiator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in testing negative for the coronavirus on Friday. The speaker said earlier that she had “great sadness” on hearing of Trump’s infection and was hopeful for “a saner approach” toward addressing the health crisis. Pelosi also said on MSNBC that the president’s illness might change the tenor of the stimulus talks by emphasizing the seriousness of the pandemic. A prominent financial backer of the president said his decision to attend a New Jersey fundraiser after he knew that one of his top aides tested positive for Covid-19 was “reckless” and imperils other events in the election’s stretch run. Dan Eberhart, chief executive officer of Canary Drilling Services LLC, said in a telephone interview that Trump’s campaign should have sent a surrogate once the president was aware that his aide Hope Hicks had tested positive for the coronavirus.

The company has been sending conspiracy theories along to its third-party fact checkers, to ensure they label them as false more quickly than usual.The social media giant said its fact checkers marked as false an item that suggested Trump’s announcement led the U.S. Air Force to launch special planes to protect against an impending attack. The company also put a fact-check label on a meme of a Simpsons’ episode featuring Trump in a coffin, which never appeared on the TV show. Facebook also said it will remove any calls for Trump’s death on the social network, or false claims that the election is being canceled or postponed. --Sarah Frier President Donald Trump’s campaign faces at least a temporary shake-up thanks to his contraction of the coronavirus. “All previously announced campaign events involving the president’s participation are in the process of being moved to virtual events or are being temporarily postponed,” the Trump campaign said in statement Friday afternoon. Former Vice President Joe Biden is traveling to Grand Rapids, Michigan on Friday for two campaign stops after delaying departure while the campaign awaited his latest test. The state is a key battleground in Biden’s quest to beat Trump next month. While the fight continues, Jen O’Malley Dillon, Biden’s campaign manager, sent an all-staff email early Friday -- possibly to prevent any gloating about the opponent -- telling staff to “refrain from posting about the situation on social media unless otherwise directed by your manager.” Vice President Mike Pence, who tested negative for the virus Friday, handled a call on the virus that the president had been slated to lead with governors. Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, tested negative Friday for coronavirus, his aide Devin O’Malley said earlier Friday. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, have tested negative for the coronavirus after learning of the president’s infection. Biden had shared a stage with Trump on Tuesday during their embattled debate. The vice presidential candidate, Senator Kamala Harris, also tested negative Friday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter. I’m happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands. Utah GOP Senator Mike Lee said he’s tested positive for Covid-19, a few days after being at the White House. Lee said in a statement that he tested negative when he went to the White House, but began experiencing symptoms consistent with allergies and “out of an abundance of caution” got another test, which came back positive. Lee, a member of the Judiciary Committee, met Tuesday with Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. On Thursday morning, Lee attended a regularly scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee meeting to discuss pending nominations. Most members of the panel were present. --Laura Litvan Senate Judiciary Cmte Republican Mike Lee of Utah met with Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, her sixth meeting with Senators at US Capitol for today. https://t.co/6UEwvIOppG pic.twitter.com/jvouvHnZ0o The New Jersey county where President Donald Trump’s Bedminster golf resort is located is starting a contact-tracing operation after his visit there Thursday. “As the public health department for Bedminster, and in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of Health, Somerset County has begun the contact tracing investigation to determine the potential risk of exposure to attendees and staff at the facility to Covid-19,” the county’s health department said. Trump held a fundraiser at his New Jersey resort on Thursday that raised $5 million. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said leaders of the congressional chamber are “looking at” instituting covid testing in the Capitol and expect decision before Congress returns from a scheduled recess that starts Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier this year they wouldn’t implement testing for members. Pelosi made masks mandatory in the Capitol following the positive diagnosis of Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, in July. She said then it was up to the Capitol Physician to determine whether members should be tested regularly. --Daniel Flatley Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the coronavirus infections of the president, first lady and a top aide mean the White House should “immediately conduct a contact tracing regime” that follows Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. He also urged “thorough testing and isolation for those who were exposed to infection risk.” “This must include strict adherence to those guidelines for all of the White House staff members that the president, first lady, and the aide came into contact with; and all of the people those individuals came into contact with whom experts deem at risk of exposure,” Schumer said in a statement. The president continued with a full schedule of events after learning on Thursday morning that his aide Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus, according to people familiar with the situation. Those included a fundraiser at his New Jersey resort that raised $5 million. The White House has not said when Trump first tested positive for the virus, but Trump said late Thursday he was awaiting results.

China is currently on weeklong Mid-Autumn festival holidays. Trump has sought to boost his popularity with voters with campaign-trail attacks on China over trade, tech companies and Beijing’s handling of the early days of the pandemic. He assailed China in a speech in late September to the United Nations General Assembly, saying it allowed “flights to leave China and infect the world.” While the official response from China was kept to well wishes, the editor of the hawkish state-linked Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, said Trump was paying the price for downplaying the severity of Covid-19 in the U.S., and said it could affect his re-election prospects. -- Rosalind Mathieson — With assistance by Joanna Ossinger, Rosalind Mathieson, Stuart Biggs, Anthony Halpin, and Laura Litvan
