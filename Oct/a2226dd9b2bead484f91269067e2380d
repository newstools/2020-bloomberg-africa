The addition of a fifth opposition member and a vice president to the electoral commission is also being discussed, according to a statement from Minister of Territorial Administration Sidiki Diakite late Wednesday. A night-time curfew in the town of Dabou was announced in a separate statement from local authorities. Tension has run high in the world’s top cocoa producer since Ouattara, who’s been in power since 2011, announced he’s seeking a third term. A ministerial delegation from the Economic Community of West African States on Monday asked the opposition to reconsider the boycott and iron out disagreements before the vote.
