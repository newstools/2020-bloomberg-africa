U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he accepts the public is angry with his handling of the pandemic, as officials confirmed thousands of positive cases had been missed from Covid test results. After months of criticism and amid a slide in the polls, Johnson also warned that the country still faces a “very tough winter” ahead. “I know people are furious and they’re furious with me,” the prime minister said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr program on Sunday. “It’s going to be bumpy through to Christmas, it may even be bumpy beyond.” The public, he said, should live “fearlessly but with common sense.” Johnson’s message was aimed at trying to persuade the public of the difficulty of his task -- to strike a balance between suppressing the virus, as new cases rise, while keeping the economy open to save jobs. Politically, he is seeking to use the Conservative Party’s conference -- forced online this year -- to reassert his authority on a fractious party and reset the agenda for his government.

He said he believes the “scientific equation will change” in the coming weeks and months. Addressing the U.K.’s broader coronavirus response, Johnson also acknowledged weaknesses in the country’s virus test and trace system, after widespread reports of poor availability and slow turnaround of tests, saying he was “frustrated with it.”
