With the end of the U.K.’s Brexit transition period on Dec. 31 fast approaching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the European Union the U.K. intends to exit the bloc with a deal similar to Canada’s or its setup with Australia - in reality a catch-all term for World Trade Organization terms. Following a lack of progress at the EU leaders’ summit on Oct. 15, he said he had concluded that a Canada-style deal wasn’t on offer and that the U.K. should prepare for arrangements “that are more like Australia’s, based on simple principles of global free trade.” Here’s a look at what both situations would mean for the U.K. Johnson has said that if no free-trade deal is possible by the end of 2020, he’s prepared to take a looser arrangement like Australia’s. It’s essentially a rebranding of the nuclear option of a “no deal” Brexit, which referred to the possibility of the U.K. leaving the EU without any deal at all. It would involve doing business on WTO terms in most areas, with tariffs on goods and an agreement on the processes to reduce some regulatory barriers. The EU’s deal with Canada was regularly mentioned during the Brexit campaign and emerged as Johnson’s favored model. The agreement was popular with the U.K. because it would allow free trade without remaining in the EU’s so-called single market, removing the need for harmonized rules and free movement of people. Back in 2016, the bloc called the free-trade accord, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement or CETA, “the most ambitious trade agreement that the EU has ever concluded.” When it entered into force provisionally the next year, the deal ended 98% of tariffs on goods, and will remove 99% of them after seven years.
