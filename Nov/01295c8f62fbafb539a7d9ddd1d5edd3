South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced measures to stop a surge in coronavirus cases in the Eastern Cape province leading to a second wave of infections throughout the country The government will intensify contact tracing and work to ensure the readiness of health authorities to respond to possible cluster outbreaks of the disease, Ramaphosa said in a speech Wednesday. The National State of Disaster will be extended by a month to Dec. 15 to allow the prevention measures to be implemented, he said. “What we are witnessing in the Eastern Cape should be a wake-up call to all of us, that we cannot relax and we cannot be complacent,” Ramaphosa said. “A resurgence can dash hopes for a swift economic recovery.” South Africa has recorded more than 740,000 cases of the coronavirus, with 20,011 deaths. The government introduced one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns to curb the spread of the disease, which has resulted in the number of new infections falling to about 2,000 a day from a peak of 12,000, Ramaphosa said. The president also announced measures to help stimulate the economy, including the restoration of normal trading hours for the sale of alcohol at retail outlets for the first time since the country’s initial lockdown started on March 27. The government will also open up international travel to all countries, subject to health protocols, to help revive the nation’s tourism industry, he said.
