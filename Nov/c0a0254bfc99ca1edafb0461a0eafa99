The Italian economy is at risk of a second recession, with a contraction forecast in the fourth quarter due to soft lockdown measures to counter a resurgence of the coronavirus, industry lobby Confindustria said in a report. The impact of the lockdown in regions including Lombardy -- home of the financial capital Milan -- should be contained compared with the decline in gross domestic product in the first two quarters of 2020, given that many businesses remain open, Confindustria said Saturday. A rapid rebound in industrial output was interrupted in September and October, and there could be a moderate decline in the fourth quarter, the report said. The Italian government is seeking parliamentary approval for 8 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of extra deficit this year, as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte battles to shield the fragile economy from the pandemic. Conteâ€™s cabinet approved the request to parliament late Friday night. The government also signed off on a third package of aid, worth 1.95 billion euros, for 2020, mainly for shops and businesses hit by the lockdown.
