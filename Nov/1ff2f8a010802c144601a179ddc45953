Ted Kaufman, the head of Joe Biden’s transition team, praised U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his early endorsement of the president-elect’s victory while other heads of government hung back. Johnson was the second world leader to receive a call from Biden after his win, a move welcomed in London as a sign the incoming White House team still sees Britain as a vital international ally. Johnson had been vocal in his support of President Donald Trump as he sought to agree a trade deal with the U.S. following Britain’s departure from the European Union, and there are concerns the new administration might drag its feet on inking an agreement.

That was a very smart move on Boris Johnson’s part,” Kaufman told BBC radio on Tuesday, adding that Biden doesn’t hold grudges. “The U.K. is a country that he really cares about, and feels that it’s really important, and he’s going to want to establish close ties.” Biden’s Rapid-Fire Calls Open New Era for U.S. and European Ties Kaufman, who has grandchildren in the U.K., said it is “way too soon” to be considering whether he might be ambassador to London. Even so, he talked up Biden’s intention to visit soon. “We can bet a beer somewhere that the first place he comes to will be England,” Kaufman said.
