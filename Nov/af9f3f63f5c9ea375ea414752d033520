Apple Inc. says Google’s in-house lawyers should be barred from seeing highly confidential material that Apple provided to the U.S. Justice Department in the government’s antitrust investigation of the search giant. Apple said in a filing Friday in federal court in Washington that while outside lawyers for Alphabet Inc.’s Google could see the material, allowing access for attorneys inside the company would result in “material harm” to Apple.
