The S&P 500 Index extended a weekly decline as traders weighed a conflict between the White House and Federal Reserve over emergency lending programs along with assurances that the government has plenty of room to help the economy. The benchmark equity gauge slumped in the wake of the disagreement over releasing government funds to further shore up growth, even as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he will try to revive stimulus talks with congressional Democrats. Pfizer Inc. rose after filing for emergency approval of its Covid-19 vaccine. Gilead Sciences Inc. fell after authorities advised against using its remdesivir drug to treat Covid-19. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index posted its third week of gains -- the best streak since July -- amid a rotation into economically sensitive sectors. Mining and energy firms led the gauge higher Friday. Global stocks hit a record Monday, but have eased off the highs in a choppy week of trading, with investors now trying to look beyond the rare show of discord between Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell that erupted amid a resurgence of virus cases and with months to go before a vaccine is widely available. The S&P 500 was set for a 0.7% weekly decline. “This public spat between the Fed and the Treasury is not a very good sign for the markets,” said John Praveen, managing director at QMA. “It kind of casts a shadow on market confidence.” Mnuchin said lawmakers should redirect unspent stimulus funding, including money he’s pulling back from the Fed. But the Fed pushed back, saying the programs served a vital role. Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, discusses her views on the outlook for the economy.
