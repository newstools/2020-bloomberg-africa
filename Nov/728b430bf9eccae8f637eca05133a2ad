The dollar’s protracted slump is spurring Group-of-10 peers to test two-year highs, underlining how it went from the ultimate haven asset at the peak of the coronavirus fears to a currency that’s weakening and forecast to fall further in 2021. The Bloomberg Dollar Index is poised for a 2.7% drop this month, taking its decline since a March peak to 12%. China’s economic rebound and bets on a successful roll-out of vaccines are bringing key levels into play for currencies from the Aussie to the euro and the Canadian dollar. “The dollar has come under pressure as risk sentiment stays buoyant -- it started at the end of the U.S. election, and was then powered further by the vaccine news,” said Alvin T. Tan, head of Asia FX Strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “The weakness has further to run.” Citigroup Inc. sees the dollar dropping as much as 20% in 2021 as vaccines become widely available, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. favors shorting the currency against the Aussie and loonie. Record virus infections in the U.S. and division over a new stimulus are also adding pressure on the world’s reserve currency. “With emergency benefits expiring at year-end, this means the U.S. outlook will remain weak as 2021 gets under way,” wrote Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. “This supports our long-standing call for continued dollar weakness.” — With assistance by Michael G Wilson
