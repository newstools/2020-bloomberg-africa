While not outright bearish yet, De Wet recommends taking a neutral stance on the rand after a seven-month, 19% rebound from a record low during the worst of the Covid-19 selloff. Once it reaches 15 per dollar, he would turn bearish, De Wet said in a client note. De Wet predicted on April 9 that the rand would recover to closer to 15 per dollar within six to nine months, from as weak as 19.35. His forecast was based on Nedbank’s so-called extreme peak model, which theorizes that the rand tends to react with extreme moves to crises, before heading back to its long-term trend. Nedbank’s “extreme peaks” model predicted the rand would rebound from April’s record low against the dollar.
