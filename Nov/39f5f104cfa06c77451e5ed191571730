Delta Air Lines Inc. will test passengers for Covid-19 on flights to Rome in a pilot program that marks the latest attempt by the airline industry to open up the lucrative market in trans-Atlantic travel. The flights from Atlanta will enable quarantine-free travel to Italy under a new policy expected soon in the European country, according to a statement Thursday by Delta. Alitalia will also offer flights between Rome and New Yorkâ€™s JFK, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Wednesday. The program will start on Dec. 19, Delta said. Italy, whose economy has been hit hard by the travel industry slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic, has been experimenting with testing between its airports in Rome and Milan. Airlines have been pushing for pre-flight tests to replace the system of restrictions, including quarantines, that have effectively eliminated flights across the North Atlantic, the most profitable corner of the global airline business.
