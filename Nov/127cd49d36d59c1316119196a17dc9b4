Cellnex Telecom SA has agreed to buy CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s European telecommunication towers for around 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion), the biggest ever acquisition by the Spanish mast operator. Cellnex will make an initial payment of about 8.6 billion euros in cash, with the rest paid with new Cellnex shares, according to filings from the companies. The deal will add around 24,600 new towers to Cellnex’s existing 60,000 sites. CK Hutchison is the latest mobile network operator to carve out mast infrastructure to cut debt and help pay for costly 5G network upgrades. Cellnex has grown aggressively through acquisitions since its initial public offering five years ago, and the deal marks its entry into three new markets. The company’s shares have soared as it drew investors with a steady stream of revenue from long-term contracts with phone companies. Talks over a potential sale were reported by Bloomberg last month.
