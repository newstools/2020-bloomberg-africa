Hospital beds are filling up across the U.S., bolstered by a surge in coronavirus cases in the Midwest, government data show. Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa are among states recording the biggest increases in Covid-19 hospitalizations over the past week, according to Department of Health and Human Services data analyzed by Bloomberg News. In North and South Dakota, more than one in five hospital patients has the pandemic disease. The U.S. set a new daily record of over 146,000 cases this week amid a new wave of infection that officials caution could be the worst the country has faced yet, as cold weather descends over many parts. Hospitalizations climbed more than 10% between Nov. 6 to Nov. 11 in six states, led by a 20.4% jump in New Jersey. North and South Dakota have the highest share of Covid-19 patients among their total in-patient population.
