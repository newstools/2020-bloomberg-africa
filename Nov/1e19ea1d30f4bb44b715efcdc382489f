Thailand’s economy improved in the third quarter after the government eased restrictions on movement and implemented a series of stimulus measures while getting the country’s Covid-19 outbreak largely under control. Gross domestic product shrank 6.4% from a year ago, the National Economic and Social Development Council said Monday, recovering from the prior quarter’s revised 12.1% contraction at the peak of the outbreak. The figure was better than the median estimate of 8.8% contraction in a Bloomberg survey of 19 economists. The council also raised its full-year forecast to a 6% contraction, from an earlier estimate of a 7.3% to 7.8% drop. With tourism and trade hit hard by the outbreak, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha has spent hundreds of billions of baht in cash handouts and stimulus measures from a 1.9 trillion-baht ($62.9 billion) economic package to support local demand. Meanwhile, a strengthening currency and political protests pose risks to the fragile recovery. All the economic indicators, barring tourism, improved in the third quarter and government spending will remain the main growth driver for next year, Danucha Pichayanan, the council’s secretary general, told a news briefing. A strengthening baht and high level of unemployment remain risks for growth next year, he said. — With assistance by Tomoko Sato, Prim Chuwiruch, and Clarissa Batino
