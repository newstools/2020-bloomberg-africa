The toll is another grim milestone after cases reported in Europe’s most-populous country exceeded 1 million on Thursday. Merkel expressed sympathy to those who have died or lost people to the virus. “And we think of those who are this very hour fighting for their lives in our hospitals,” she added. Cases in Germany have more than tripled since the start of October, with the number of infected people in intensive care climbing to record levels. Like other European nations, Germany has imposed stricter measures in recent weeks to stop the disease from spreading. Merkel and the leaders of Germany’s 16 states agreed Wednesday to tighten limits on private gatherings but kept schools and most businesses operating to help limit the impact on the economy. In contrast to nations like France and the U.K., Germany’s curbs have yielded little progress in slowing the disease’s spread. The chancellor said this week that restrictions will remain in place until January, while her chief of staff raised the possibility of them being extended until March. In her podcast, which also praised Germany’s communal efforts to combat the virus, Merkel said several vaccines “could be available within the foreseeable future.”
