Nigerian inflation quickened for a 14th straight month in October on rising food prices caused by border closures, dollar restrictions and banditry attacks that are preventing farmers from producing food. Consumer prices rose 14.2% from a year earlier, compared with 13.7% in September, Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said Monday in a report published on its website. The median estimate of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 14.1%. Costs rose 1.54% in the month. The rising rate will cast a spotlight on the current very low levels of market interest rates and raise questions on the central bank’s near-term plan for containing further price pressures, Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank, said by email. — With assistance by Alonso Soto, and Simbarashe Gumbo
