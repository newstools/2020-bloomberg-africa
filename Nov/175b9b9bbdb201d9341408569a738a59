 Denmark is imposing new restrictions on the movement of its citizens after discovering a mutation of Covid-19 in the country’s mink population that could derail global efforts to develop a vaccine. Health officials say the new strain of the virus affects the spike protein, which could make it particularly dangerous. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is due to hold a press briefing on the situation later on Thursday. Her government is planning to cull up to 17 million mink -- the country’s entire population -- in an effort to contain the outbreak. A mink farm in North Jutland, Denmark.

Cases of Covid-19 were found in over 200 out of more than 1,100 Danish mink farms, the government said on Wednesday. People who have contracted the new form of the virus don’t appear to be suffering more severe symptoms, according to Danish health officials. The virus was most likely originally transmitted to the mink from humans, and then back again. The new restrictions will apply to northern Jutland, which is part of western Denmark, and home to the country’s mink production. Though the government has yet to provide details, a number of local mayors have said that citizens will no longer be free to move outside the municipalities in which they live.
