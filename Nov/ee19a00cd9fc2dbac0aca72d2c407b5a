The so-called “National Development Strategy 1,” replaces the Transitional Stabilisation Program, which Mnangagwa said had delivered “notable and critical successes.” While annual inflation is at 471%, it’s tapered off for three straight months and the Zimbabwean dollar has stabilized at around $82 per U.S dollar. The new economic blueprint will also serve as a precursor to the national budget statement that Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube will present to lawmakers later this month. The new plan, known as NDS 1, will focus on “accelerated growth,” driven by agriculture, mining, manufacturing and tourism, Mnangagwa said. The southern African nation, which owes more than $8 billion to international financial institutions, still hopes to pursue an arrears-clearance program with the multilaterals including the World Bank, Ncube told reporters.
