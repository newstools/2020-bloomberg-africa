AstraZeneca Plc said its blood-cancer medicine Calquence failed to help patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms of Covid-19. The group of patients taking the drug in addition to standard care didn’t show fewer deaths or respiratory failures, the U.K. drugmaker said in a statement. Details of the intermediate clinical trials will be presented in due course, the company said. The Astra study is one of many programs to evaluate known treatments -- from antiviral drugs to plasma from recovered patients -- against the pandemic virus. Other disappointments include Sanofi’s rheumatoid arthritis medicine Kevzara. Astra also has a Covid vaccine candidate under development with the University of Oxford, as well as a potential antibody treatment for the disease.
