The manager of the Invesco Global Focus Fund, which has returned 46% this year and consistently ranks in the top 1% of similar funds, joins the latest “What Goes Up” podcast to discuss how he approaches investing and the recent rotation in equities. Some highlights of the conversation:“I remember stepping up in front of a roomful of people 12, 13 years ago when I first launched the fund and I put those boxes up and I said, ‘this is where money goes to die.’ And I stand by what I said 13 years ago: The world doesn't work that way. And allocating that way has never made any sense to me. It's a great way to own too much, and to lock in underperformance.”Mentioned in this podcast: ‘Very, Very Busy Week’ Wipes Out Traders’ Usual Holiday Doldrums Chaos in Factor Land Puts Quants on Hunt for Accidental Exposure
