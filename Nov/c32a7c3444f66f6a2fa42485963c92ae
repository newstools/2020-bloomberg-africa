Deaths in the country of 38 million last month amounted to 49,132, about 40% higher than on average in past years and the first such spike during the pandemic. While the country reported 3,118 Covid-19 deaths in October, less than 7% of the total number of deceased, the virus  played a much bigger role.

Some people may be afraid to visit doctors for fear of being swept up in the pandemic, he said. As is the case across Europe, hospitals are increasingly focusing only on treating coronavirus patients, which leads to delays in other procedures. As of Wednesday, 21,899 Covid beds were occupied, about two-thirds of total capacity. Poland’s spike in new infections peaked last week at nearly 30,000 cases a day. New cases dropped to 22,632 on Wednesday, below a level the government said would trigger a “national quarantine” or full lockdown.
