Republican and former broadcast television anchor Maria Elvira Salazar defeated Democratic Representative Donna Shalala in Floridaâ€™s 27th Congressional District, the Associated Press projected. The two also faced each other in 2018, when Shalala won the Miami-area district by six points, flipping it after 30-year incumbent Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen retired.
