 Pennsylvania Republicans sued officials in a suburban county near Philadelphia that is expected to heavily favor Democrats, alleging they illegally allowed absentee and mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day. The suit targeting Montgomery County officials was filed in federal court in Philadelphia on Tuesday by Kathy Barnette, a Republican candidate for Congress, and Clay Breece, the chairman of the Berks County Republican Party. The suit also alleges county officials are allowing some voters with defects in their ballots to correct them. In Pennsylvania, vote tabulation is prohibited until 7 a.m. on Election Day. The Republicans further accuse Montgomery County of restricting their ability to monitor the count by forcing their representatives into a “tiny holding pen” that doesn’t allow them to adequately view the proceedings or in a overflow room with televisions. Montgomery County and the other Philadelphia suburbs are expected to favor Democrat Joe Biden. In 2016, nearly 60% of Montgomery County voters went for Hillary Clinton. The suit comes after President Donald Trump pledged a fierce legal fight over vote counting that would drag on after polls close. The battle so far has focused mostly on curtailing Democratic efforts to loosen rules for voting by mail.
