Guinea’s Constitutional Court on Saturday confirmed last month’s election of President Alpha Conde, declaring that the vote was regular. Conde will be sworn in after he won 59.5% of the vote, the head of the court, Mohamed Lamine Bangoura, said in the ruling. The court received four requests seeking a partial or total annulment of election results in the world’s top bauxite exporter. Opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo claimed that the voting was marred by irregularities such as ballot-box stuffing. Diallo, the West African nation’s former prime minister, garnered 33.5% of the vote. The court decision represents the “assassination of democracy and of the rule of law in our country,” Diallo said in a statement. “It is a well-deserved victory and we believe Conde will continue all the projects he has started,” said Zalikatou Diallo, an official of the ruling Rally of the Guinean People party.
