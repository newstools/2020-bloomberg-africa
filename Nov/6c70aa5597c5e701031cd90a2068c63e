India stocks rose amid vote counting in the U.S. elections. The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.7% to 40,525.81 as of 9:37 a.m. in Mumbai, while the NSE Nifty 50 Index advanced 0.5%. “Our market is going to follow global cues and will be volatile through the day,” said Shrikant Chouhan, a technical analyst at Kotak Securities Ltd. “Traders should look to buy on any dips, because quarterly earnings have been better than expected and India’s Covid numbers are also improving.” As the earnings season for the quarter ended September rolls on, State Bank of India is due to report its results today. Twenty-four of the 36 companies on the Nifty 50 index that have reported results so far have beaten or matched analyst estimates. — With assistance by Paresh Jatakia
