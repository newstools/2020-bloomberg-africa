The government is expected to spend 2.5 billion rupees in Mahebourg consolidating existing infrastructure and adding amenities to the waterfront esplanade over six years. Private sector-led projects will contribute 4 billion rupees for affordable housing, mixed-use development and ecological zones. Port Louis-based Le Defi Plus reported the plans earlier. Mahebourg is the biggest of the villages facing a double challenge on the southeastern coast. Tourism is nonexistent during the Covid-19 pandemic, a major economic blow to the Indian Ocean island nation. An oil spill after a vessel ran aground in July further impacted the village, home to fishermen and a cultural landmark.
