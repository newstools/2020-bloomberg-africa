Most Middle East stock markets advanced, taking their cue from rising crude oil prices and gains elsewhere in emerging markets last week. Indexes in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Egypt, and Bahrain climbed as much as 1% on Sunday. The Tadawul All Share Index in Riyadh rose for the sixth consecutive session to trade at the highest level since July 2019. Gauges in Dubai, Israel and Kuwait fell, while Oman and Qatar were little changed. The prospect of the formal start to U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s transition to power and optimism that the roll-out of vaccines will speed up the economic recovery helped drive emerging-market stocks and currencies to their fourth week of gains through Friday. Oil also rallied ahead of an OPEC+ ministerial gathering this week. Sunday’s gains defied increased tensions in the region following the killing of Iran’s top nuclear scientist on Friday. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani accused Israel of what he called an “act of terrorism,” saying his country will respond “when the time is right.” MIDDLE EASTERN MARKETS:
