Asian equities ended the week in a cautious fashion as investors assessed valuations following the rapid rise in global stocks this month and the enduring pandemic in parts of Europe and the U.S. Oil retreated amid rising tensions within OPEC+ members. Shares underperformed in Australia and Hong Kong, while Japan edged up, as the MSCI Asia Pacific Index remained on course for a 12% November surge. S&P 500 contracts dipped and Treasuries advanced. Volumes may be lower than average on Friday with reduced trading hours for U.S. stocks and bonds. Bitcoin steadied after sliding almost 10% on Thursday.

AstraZeneca Plc is likely to conduct a further global trial of its vaccine after current studies raised questions, CEO Pascal Soriot said in an interview. The task of vaccinating the world’s population is rife with logistical problems, all while the virus gains ground and economic recoveries wobble. “Vaccine optimism continues to stir momentum going into December that could confront a slowing economy and liquidity difficulties,” said Ben Emons, managing director for global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. “Yet, the expectation of a full reopening of the global economy remains firmly priced.” Political clarity has also driven risk assets this month, as President-elect Joe Biden continues his transition to power. President Donald Trump said he’ll relinquish power if the Electoral College affirms Biden’s win, but he signaled he may never formally concede defeat, and may skip the Democrat’s inauguration. Global stocks remain on track for the best month on record, up 13%, and that’s lifted valuations to near the highest in about 20 years. Here are some key events coming up: AstraZeneca Plc is likely to conduct an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine, according to Pascal Soriot, the company’s chief executive officer, after current studies raised questions over its level of protection.
