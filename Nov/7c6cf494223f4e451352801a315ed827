The world’s largest independent oil trader doubts that new coronavirus lockdowns in Europe will lead to another significant drop in crude prices following last week’s rout. “This is a speed bump,” Mike Muller, the head of Asia for Vitol Group, said in an interview Sunday with Dubai-based consultant Gulf Intelligence. “We are not going to see a violent reaction in price on Monday.” Benchmark Brent crude fell 10% in the five days through Friday to $37.46 a barrel, its lowest since May, as daily Covid-19 cases hit a record in the U.S. and nations including France and Germany announced new lockdowns. The U.K. followed suit on Saturday.

Demand was 1.5 million barrels a day in France and 2.3 million in Germany. OPEC+ -- an alliance of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers such as Russia -- has helped bolster prices since it agreed to output cuts in April. The group was meant to ease those curbs by 2 million barrels a day in January, but it may be forced into a delay given oil’s renewed weakness.
