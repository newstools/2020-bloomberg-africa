An index measuring South African manufacturing sentiment rose to the highest level yet in October as the demand continued to recover from coronavirus lockdown measures. Absa Group Ltd.’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by the Bureau for Economic Research, increased to 60.9 from a revised 58.5 in September, the Johannesburg-based lender said Monday in an emailed statement. That’s the first time the index has topped 60 and is the highest since record-keeping began September 1999.
