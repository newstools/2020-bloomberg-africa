California added 15,442 new coronavirus cases, hitting a new high as the state’s nighttime curfew kicks in Saturday night. The new cases topped Friday’s record of 13,005 infections, bringing the total to almost 1.1 million. The number of deaths increased by 86 to 18,643, state data showed. The increased patient load left California’s hospitals with just 1,921 intensive-case unit beds available, near the low in July. A 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew will be imposed in most counties for a month to ease the rate of infection. The rise of #COVID19 cases in CA could put millions of lives in danger & impact our health care system.To #stopthesurge, all non-essential work & activities must stop from 10PM-5AM in purple tier counties under the new Limited Stay at Home Order. https://t.co/z5l4vxMwvR pic.twitter.com/ucwhnHj9oO
