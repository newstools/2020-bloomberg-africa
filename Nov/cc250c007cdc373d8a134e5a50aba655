Fatalities where the disease was mentioned on the death certificate totaled 1,379 in the period, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday. That’s up more than 40% from 978 in the previous week. The total number of deaths registered was 10.1% above the five-year average -- similar to the number reported last week. Covid deaths accounted for 12.7% of all fatalities in England and Wales during the period. Hopes are rising that a vaccine will prove effective against the disease after Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE said preliminary results found their project prevented more than 90% of symptomatic infections. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Britons to keep following coronavirus restrictions despite the breakthrough, saying it is “very, very early days.”
