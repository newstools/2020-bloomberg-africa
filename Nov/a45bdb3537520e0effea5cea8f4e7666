Diallo, the West African nation’s former prime minister, had claimed an early victory for the Oct. 18 vote based on the figures his party, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, said it gathered from polling stations. Guinea’s Electoral Commission declared the 82-year-old Conde winner of the election after he garnered 59% of the vote against Diallo’s 33%. While the vote was largely peaceful, the post-election period has been marred by violence as supporters of the opposition clashed with security forces in Conakry, Guinea’s capital. At least 20 people were killed in protests that followed Diallo’s announcement that he had won the vote, according to the government.
