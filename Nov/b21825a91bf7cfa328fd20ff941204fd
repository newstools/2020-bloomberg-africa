The charges were put to African National Congress Secretary-General Ace Magashule at an appearance in the Magistrate Court in the central city of Bloemfontein on Friday. The court granted Magashule bail of 200,000 rand ($12,802) and ordered him to appear again on Feb. 19. Magashule, who currently oversees the day-to-day running of the ANC, is the highest-profile serving politician to face charges since President Cyril Ramaphosa took office in 2018 and pledged to crack down on the corruption that became endemic during his predecessor Jacob Zuma’s rule. The government estimated that more than 500 billion rand was stolen. “The investigations are done and we are ready for trial,” the National Prosecuting Authority said in a statement. Magashule’s former personal assistant, Moroadi Cholota, has turned state witness, state prosecutor Johan de Nysschen said. The case against Magashule relates to a 255 million-rand asbestos audit contract that was awarded in the Free State, according to the police’s special investigating unit. Magashule is being charged along with seven other people, and at least three more are expected to be added to the charge sheet, the NPA said. Magashule allegedly received various payments from murdered businessman Ignatius Mpambani, the owner of one of two companies awarded the asbestos contract, the NPA said. He also allegedly failed to report corrupt transactions, it said. Magashule didn’t enter a plea and his lawyer, Laurence Hodes, didn’t answer calls seeking comment. Magashule has yet to say whether he’ll comply with a directive from the ANC’s top leadership to vacate his post until his trial is complete.
