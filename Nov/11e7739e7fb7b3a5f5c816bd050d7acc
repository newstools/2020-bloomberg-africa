The committee will discuss the plan with the Japanese and Tokyo metropolitan governments and decide next month how to split the costs, Yomiuri said Sunday, citing unidentified Olympic officials.

Virus-Delayed Tokyo Olympics Looks to Allow Spectators Yomiuri said members of the organizing committee had initially voiced concern that the extra costs could run to as much as 300 billion yen, but ultimately agreed with the International Olympic Committee to simplify aspects of the games to save money. The additional costs don’t include countermeasures against the spread of Covid-19, as these are primarily being handled by the Japanese government, Yomiuri reported.
