Germany’s auto industry secured 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in government aid to help weather the coronavirus crisis and invest in the transition to electric cars. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government will extend cash bonuses for purchasing electric-powered vehicles until 2025, making an additional 1 billion euros available. The package also augments 2 billion euros in existing support with a 1 billion-euro program to replace aging trucks and 1 billion euros in aid for suppliers struggling to invest in new technology as the pandemic saps demand. “We are all aware that the industry is going through a difficult phase that affects hundreds of thousands of jobs,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Tuesday in Berlin. Carmakers and parts suppliers, which employ nearly 800,000 people in Germany, were spending heavily on electric cars. That left companies exposed to the sudden drop in demand from the fallout of the coronavirus -- auto production plunged 97% in April and has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Germany’s carmakers, once world leaders in automotive innovation, have been playing catch up on electric cars. Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG combined are valued at less than half of Tesla Inc., which is building a factory just outside Berlin to challenge the German car giants on their home turf. The struggles extend to hundreds of parts makers -- companies often specialized in combustion engines components and with fewer resources than big carmakers. Even big suppliers like Continental AG are suffering. Europe’s second-largest parts maker has widened cuts this year and last week forecast that profitability will shrink for the fourth time in five years. — With assistance by Christoph Rauwald
