Photographer: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images Photographer: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images Mozambique is ready to receive any support in its fight against Islamists in the northern natural-gas-rich Cabo Delgado province, Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, citing President Filipe Nyusi. The government is working with its counterparts in Europe, the U.S., Asia and Africa to counter terrorism, the news agency cited Nyusi as saying, without providing further details. More than 2,300 people have died in the violence that began three years ago, including reports of mass beheadings earlier this month, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, which tracks the fighting. The war has already displaced more than 500,000 people in the province where Total SE plans to spend $20 billion on a natural-gas export project, privately owned Mozambican newspaper O Pais reported Thursday, citing Prime Minister Carlos Agostinho do Rosário. That’s more than a fifth of Cabo Delgado’s population.
