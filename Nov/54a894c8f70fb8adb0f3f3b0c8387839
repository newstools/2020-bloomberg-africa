Datadog Inc. tumbled in extended trading after an estimate-beating revenue forecast failed to satisfy investors that have watched the stock more than double this year. The maker of data-monitoring software forecast fourth quarter revenue of $162 million to $164 million, exceeding the highest analyst estimate tracked by Bloomberg. Its third-quarter revenue and earnings per share excluding some items also topped the highest estimates. The stock fell as much as 11%. Datadog also reported an extension of a partnership with Alphabetâ€™s Google for cloud applications.
