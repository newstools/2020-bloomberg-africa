Theo Epstein, the baseball executive who helped the Chicago Cubs snap their 108-year World Series drought, has resigned as the team’s president of baseball operations. Epstein’s last day in charge will be Nov. 20, according to a statement from the Cubs. He led the organization for nine seasons. The executive was at the helm of the Boston Red Sox and the Cubs when they broke two of the most legendary curses in Major League Baseball history. In total, Epstein has been in charge of three World Series winners, two with the Red Sox and one with the Cubs. The move is hardly surprising: Epstein has said that coaches and executives shouldn’t stay in any role for too long. Jed Hoyer, who worked with Epstein in Boston and Chicago, will become the Cubs’ new president of baseball operations. Epstein, 46, is under contract with the Cubs through 2021, leading baseball observers to speculate he’ll sit out the coming season.
