The nomination follows the resignation of Mohit Dhoorundhur due to health reasons, the Port Louis-based newspaper said. Servansingh, who has held similar positions at public companies, declined to comment when contacted by phone on Sunday. His LinkedIn page currently shows him as chairman of MindAfrica Group, which provides advisory services. SBM Bank, a unit of SBM Holdings Ltd., has also proceeded with changes at management level.

For the quarter through September, SBM Holdings said attributable profit fell 42% to 150.3 million rupees ($3.75 million) from a year ago on impairment charges.
