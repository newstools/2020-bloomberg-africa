The Mozambican government had in March last year made a competing extradition request, but charges were delayed until now. A lawyer for Chang didn’t immediately respond to a call or a text message seeking comment. Chang has previously denied wrongdoing. Mozambique was rocked by the financial saga, which emerged in 2016 when the government reported previously undisclosed debts that led to a default on Eurobond payments. Known informally as the tuna-bond scandal, as one loan was raised to finance fishing boats, the three Credit Suisse bankers were accused of working with Chang to arrange kickbacks and other payments.

The son of former Mozambican President Armando Guebuza has also been charged and detained in Mozambique along with 19 others, including the former head of state security. They have denied wrongdoing and are yet to be tried.
