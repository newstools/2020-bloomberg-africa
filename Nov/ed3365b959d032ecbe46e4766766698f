A TikTok employee who sued the Trump administration over its ban of the video-sharing app has agreed to drop his case. Patrick S. Ryan submitted a filing dated Nov. 13, stating that both sides were asking the court to dismiss the case with prejudice. No reason was given. TikTok owner Bytedance Ltd. this week won a 15-day extension of its deadline to sell U.S. assets and the Commerce Department said it wouldnâ€™t move forward with a ban on U.S. residents using the app, in light of two court injunctions. The case is Ryan v. Trump, 20-CV-05948, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).
