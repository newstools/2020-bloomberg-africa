Sweden is bumping up against the limits of a strategy that has so far relied on recommendations rather than rules to stop people transmitting the coronavirus. The country famously avoided a lockdown earlier this year, arguing instead that citizens would voluntarily do the right thing. But this week, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven took what he called the “unprecedented” step of banning public gatherings larger than eight people, amid signs that Sweden’s softer approach is falling short. On Tuesday, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said Swedes appear to be paying less attention to social distancing guidelines now than when the pandemic first erupted. That’s despite warnings from Lofven that Sweden faces a “really dark” winter with the virus. “We can see how many people are working from home,” Tegnell told reporters in Stockholm. “It’s not as high as it was during spring.” Lofven this week implored Swedes to “cancel” all activity that might spread the virus as he relies on rhetoric rather than rules to shape behavior. “The prime minister is definitely right in saying we need to do more,” Tegnell said. He also acknowledged there are potential legal barriers to imposing further restrictions. “It’s a legally very difficult area that we’d get into then,” he said. About 70% of Sweden’s intensive care units are now full. As of Tuesday, 168 people in ICU had Covid, representing a seven-fold increase since early October. Figures remain well below the extremes seen earlier in the year, but Tegnell said the situation looks “serious.” Meanwhile, cases are approaching 200,000, and fatalities remain much higher than in the rest of the Nordic region. “There are indications that adherence is increasing, but we’re not back to the levels we were at during spring,” Tegnell said.
