Preliminary data from the Turkey Exporters’ Assembly suggests October’s drop in shipments was even bigger. A late November phone call between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Arabia’s King Salman signaled a possible thaw in ties, and interviews in Riyadh suggest curbs on the sale of products made in Turkey are being eased.
