Amy Coney Barrett U.S. Supreme Court conservatives including new Justice Amy Coney Barrett weighed bolstering religious rights in a case that could let a Catholic charity refuse to work with same-sex couples when helping to place foster children in Philadelphia. Hearing arguments by phone Wednesday, the court’s strengthened conservative wing questioned Philadelphia’s effort to enforce its anti-discrimination requirements in contracts with the private agencies that screen potential foster families. The case promises an early indication of how aggressive the court will be in protecting religious freedoms -- and limiting gay rights -- now that Barrett has replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and created a 6-3 conservative majority. The court is scheduled to rule by late June in the case, which centers on the constitutional guarantee of free exercise of religion. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito were the most clearly skeptical of Philadelphia’s policy. Kavanaugh said the city was “looking for a fight.”“What I fear here is that the absolutist and extreme position that you’re articulating would require us to go back on the promise of respect for religious believers,” Kavanaugh told the city’s lawyer.Liberal justices explored possible middle grounds. Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked a second lawyer defending the policy whether he could offer a compromise. Among the conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch didn’t clearly indicate which way they were leaning.Barrett asked a number of technical questions. She also asked what would happen if a state took over all its hospitals, contracted with private entities to run the facilities and then required them to perform abortions.
