South Africa’s National Treasury said a Cabinet decision to bailout the country’s insolvent national airline hasn’t changed after Tito Mboweni, the finance minister, questioned in a series of tweets on Sunday whether the country needed it. “The allocation of the 10.5 billion rand is a Cabinet decision and it still stands,” the Treasury said on Tuesday in response to queries.
