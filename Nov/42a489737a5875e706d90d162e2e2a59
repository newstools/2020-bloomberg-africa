Britons who returned to the workforce after the U.K.’s first lockdown this year received a harsh welcome. The number of people moving from economic inactivity to unemployment surged to a record in the third quarter as new job seekers struggled to find work in the virus-stricken economy, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed Tuesday.

Few succeeded in finding jobs after the easing of restrictions over the summer, with the number of people moving into work falling to the lowest level since 2009. With the jobless rate climbing to the highest in four years, the government has extended a wage subsidy program through March. While that may help those at risk of losing their jobs, it won’t provide much comfort to those seeking a new one.
