The Eskom Kendal coal-fired power station in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., South Africa’s state power utility, was ordered to comply with pollution limits at three of its coal-fired plants this year while two more are being investigated, the government’s environment department said in its first disclosure about most of the orders. The violations listed in the National Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Report 2019-20 include excessive emissions of particulate matter and groundwater pollution. The violations and orders are as follows: “Our environmental performance continues to be deeply disappointing, with both emissions and water usage performance far exceeding targets,” Eskom said in its annual results report released on Oct. 31. “We are redoubling our efforts to improve our compliance with legislated standards.” Eskom’s particulate matter emissions are the worst since 1997, the company said in the report. The utility said it could comment later when contacted about the report.
