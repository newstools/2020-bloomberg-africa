The U.S. government will undertake what could be a final national security review this week of a potential deal for Oracle Corp. to purchase TikTok’s American operations, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. The deal, if finalized, would create what Mnuchin called “TikTok Global.” He added that the unit would have its headquarters in the U.S. and create 20,000 jobs. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, will meet this week before it makes its recommendation to President Donald Trump, who will then make a decision. Mnuchin said the deadline for a deal, according to Trump’s executive order, is Sept. 20.

The deal must also go through a separate national security review, he said, in order to comply with Trump’s executive orders last month.
