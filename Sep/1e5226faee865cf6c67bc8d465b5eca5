Boris Johnson’s government imposed quarantine restrictions on travelers arriving in England from mainland Portugal as it tries to limit the number of coronavirus cases imported from overseas. People arriving from Portugal -- except the islands of the Azores and Madeira -- as well as Hungary, French Polynesia and Reunion will have to self-isolate for 14 days as of 4 a.m. on Saturday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a tweet. Data shows we need to remove PORTUGAL (minus the AZORES and MADEIRA), HUNGARY, FRENCH POLYNESIA and REUNION from the Travel Corridor list to keep everyone safe. If you arrive in England from these destinations after 4am Saturday, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days. “Through enhanced data we now have the capability to assess islands separate to their mainland countries,” Shapps said. Sweden will be removed from the list of countries triggering quarantine requirements, he said. The latest decision follows the move to impose restrictions on seven Greek islands earlier this week.
