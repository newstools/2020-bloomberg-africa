Consumer prices rose 15.7% from a year earlier, compared with 15.5% in August, Mulenga Musepa, the interim statistician general at the Zambia Statistics Agency, told reporters Thursday in Lusaka, the capital. Costs increased 1.4% in the month. The increase in the headline rate was due to non-food items, such as vehicles, furniture and housing, Musepa said. Annual food inflation slowed 14% in September from 15.5% a month earlier. Price growth has been above the central bank’s target band of 6% to 8% for more than a year and may accelerate following the continued depreciation of Zambia’s currency.
