The group, including several members of parliament, have been detained since December in connection with an alleged attempted coup, for which Soro is also wanted. “This is a good opportunity for the opposition to commit to peace,” said Toure by phone, without giving more details. The world’s top cocoa grower appears to be headed for tense polls. President Alassane Ouattara announced last month that he would be seeking a controversial third term.
