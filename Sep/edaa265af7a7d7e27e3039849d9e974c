Kuwait’s main equity index led gains in the Middle East as banking shares including Kuwait Finance House KSCP and National Bank of Kuwait SAKP pushed it higher. The Premier Market index of the biggest and most liquid shares in Kuwait closed 1.1% higher on Sunday. Index provider MSCI Inc.’s review of its benchmarks in November will be a driving factor for Kuwait’s stock market for the next two months, CI Capital Senior Analyst Sara Boutros said.
