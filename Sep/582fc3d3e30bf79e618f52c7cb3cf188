The finding brings to an end months of speculation about why at least 330 elephants were found dead in a region of the country this year, with possible explanations ranging from anthrax to poisoning. “We have a number of hypotheses we are working on,” said Mmadi Reuben, veterinary officer in the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, at a press conference. “Elephants are the only animals drinking below the surface of the water and sucking the silt, which is where these toxins reside.” Botswana’s 135,000 elephants have become a political issue because some people say there are too many. While they are a key part of a tourism industry that’s usually worth $2 billion a year, they also sometimes eat the crops of villagers and a number of people have died due to encounters with the animals.
