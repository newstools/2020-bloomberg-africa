Nigeria approved the development of a northern rail line to link it with neighboring Niger at a cost of $1.96 billion, Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi said. The line will link Kano and Katsina in northern Nigeria with the city of Maradi in southern Niger to facilitate the movement of goods between both countries, the minister told reporters Wednesday at the end of the weekly cabinet meeting in the capital, Abuja.
