A logo sits on a glass door in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. South Africa’s main stock benchmark traded broadly neutral as of 10:08 a.m. in Johannesburg, as advances by index giants Naspers Ltd, BHP Group Plc, Richemont, which make up 40% of market capitalization, offset weakness among precious metal miners and banks. 103 of the 142 listed companies traded lower in the morning. Before today, the index fell for five consecutive sessions, the longest losing streak since May 2019. South Africa’s negative performance since last week falls in line with markets in Asia and Europe, as investors weigh the dimming outlook for further U.S. fiscal stimulus, rising Covid-19 cases in a number of nations and expected market volatility around the presidential election. U.S.-China tensions are also simmering, with doubts emerging over whether Oracle Corp.’s deal with TikTok will win U.S. and Chinese government assent. NEWS:
