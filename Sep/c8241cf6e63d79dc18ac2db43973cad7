It will also offer lenders from Lagos a reprieve from rules that are far more onerous than what their counterparts in Nairobi have to contend with, said Adesoji Solanke, director for frontier and sub-Saharan African banks equity research at Renaissance Capital. “Nigerian banks are faced with a very punitive regulatory environment at home, so their thinking is to potentially scale-up their operations out of Nigeria so that those can contribute significantly more to their group revenue and profit,” he said in an interview. Nigerian banks need to hold 27.5% of their cash as reserves, six times that of their Kenyan counterparts, while at the same time having to extend 65% of their deposits as loans. Mathematically Impossible Rules Stump Nigeria Banks on Loans Kenya has too many banks relative to size of the population, meaning more consolidation is inevitable following at least five takeovers over the past year, Solanke said. There is a concentration of a few big banks at the top and a long tail of small- and mid-sized firms, he said. “You would likely continue to see international banks trying to find ways to either get into the market by buying one of the banks in the country, or where they do have operations currently in the country, trying to scale-up their existing businesses,” Solanke said. Nigeria’s Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, the West African nation’s biggest lender by market capitalization, also operates in Kenya, having acquired Fina Bank Group in 2014.
