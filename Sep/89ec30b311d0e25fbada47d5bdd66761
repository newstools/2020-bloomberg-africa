Canadian trade with the rest of the world continued its recovery to more normal levels as the global economy rebounded from Covid-19 lockdowns. Merchandise exports rose 11.1% in July, adding to a 20.5% gain in June, Statistics Canada said Thursday in Ottawa. Imports increased 12.7% in July, after gaining 20.3% in June. Combined, exports and imports have increased 35% since falling to a decade-low in April, leaving them 5% short of pre-pandemic levels. The figures reinforce confidence that Canada’s rebound is well underway, though economists still caution a full recovery is far from assured at a time with the pandemic ongoing. While global trade has been robust in some sectors like autos, other industries are still languishing, including travel. “July’s trade data joins other indicators in confirming that Canada’s recovery has remained intact,” Omar Abdelrahman, an economist at Toronto Dominion Bank, said in a report. “However, notable headwinds mean that the road forward for both is mired with uncertainty. For one, growth in services trade, as evidenced by today’s report, is expected to remain restrained.” The country’s service exports are still down 23% from pre-pandemic levels. Merchandise exports are only 6% below February levels, while goods imports are down 4.1%. The quicker rebound in imports caused the country’s merchandise trade deficit to widen to C$2.45 billion ($1.87 billion) in July, from a revised C$1.59 billion in June. Economists had expected a deficit of C$2.5 billion. Motor vehicles and parts were the biggest contributors to the increase in exports and imports, the agency said. — With assistance by Erik Hertzberg
