South Africa’s main stock benchmark drops as much as 2.9% to the lowest June 17 as rising virus cases hammer risk sentiment, dragging global markets lower. “Investors are becoming increasingly worried about the momentum in the economic recovery given the resurgent numbers of global Covid-19 cases and lack of progress on a new U.S. stimulus package,” Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said in an emailed note. Monday’s weakness extends the FTSE/JSE Africa All Shares Index’s slide to a fifth consecutive day, the longest losing streak since May 2019. Some 121 of the 142 index members were trading lower at 1 p.m. local time.
