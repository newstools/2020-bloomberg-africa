The National Treasury said in July it would help “mobilize” the more than 10 billion rand ($611 million) needed for SAA restart flights six months after planes were grounded to help curb the coronavirus. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said at the time the cash should come from private investors or partners, and while the government has said it’s talking to suitors no deal has been agreed. The state “is working with transaction advisors to assess proposals from several potential strategic equity partners for the airline,” a spokesman for the Department of Public Enterprises said in a statement on Thursday. The administrators will update creditors on SAA’s financial position at the meeting, according to a letter they sent to affected parties.
