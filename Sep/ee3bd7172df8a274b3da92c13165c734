A Greek newspaper’s website appeared to have been hacked after printing an expletive-laden headline that the Turkish government said insulted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Saturday morning, the Dimokratia News homepage was replaced with a Turkish message that read: “The Turks are here, where are you?” By midday Turkish time, the message had been removed but the website was still down. Dimokratia published the headline on its front page on Friday, prompting the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the Greek ambassador. In a statement, the Greek Foreign Ministry condemned the use of insulting language, which it said did not reflect the country’s political culture. Strongly condemning the insult against President @RTErdogan in a Greek newspaper, Director of Communications @fahrettinaltun sent a letter to his Greek counterpart Stelios Petsas, urging the Greek government to take action against the involved parties.https://t.co/CMfrv1eG86 pic.twitter.com/cRMitZ122J Tensions between Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have risen since Turkey resumed exploration for hydrocarbons in disputed waters in August.
