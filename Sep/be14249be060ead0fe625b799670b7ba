U.K. manufacturers renewed their call for an exit deal with the European Union, backing it up with fresh data highlighting Britain’s reliance on trade with its closest neighbors. Make U.K. found that eight of the top ten markets for British-made products are in Europe. Exports to the top six European destinations, which include Germany, France and the Netherlands, were worth 117.4 billion pounds ($152.6 billion.) “These figures lay bare the overwhelming importance for manufacturers of trade with our closest market and the need to avoid imposing any barriers which will make this more difficult,” Make U.K. head Stephen Phipson said in a statement on Thursday. “For U.K. manufacturers, access to their biggest market must be a premium.” Europe is the top destination for U.K. manufactured exports Source: Make U.K. Note: Switzerland is part of the single market, though not part of the EU The British government has upped its rhetoric on Brexit in recent days, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson planning to break international law and re-write the divorce deal agreed with the bloc.

That would also put thousands of high-paying jobs at risk.
