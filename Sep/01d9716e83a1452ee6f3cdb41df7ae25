An arbitration panel convened over a soured gas-supply contract imposed the penalty in 2017 and a U.K. court upheld the award last year. Nigeria is seeking to overturn the decision by arguing that evidence of corruption perpetrated by the British Virgin Islands-registered company has only recently been discovered. Last week, a British judge granted Nigeria’s request to take its fraud case against P&ID to trial. Settlement negotiations between the parties took place on several occasions before the panel issued the final award three years ago but failed to come to an agreement.
