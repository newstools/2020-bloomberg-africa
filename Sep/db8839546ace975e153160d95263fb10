Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was sworn in for his sixth term in an unannounced ceremony Wednesday that caught his opponents by surprise. As police cut off most of the center of the capital Minsk, the presidential motorcade headed down deserted avenues toward the imposing Palace of Independence where Lukashenko took the presidential oath extending his 26-year rule. The stealthy swearing-in was the latest move by the longtime leader to shore up his power even as hundreds of thousands of opponents continue to turn out across the country for weekly protests against his rule. The uprising began after Lukashenkoâ€™s claim of a landslide victory in elections Aug. 9 that opponents and Western governments say were rigged. Violent police crackdowns on protesters in the ensuing weeks have drawn broad international criticism. Authorities have forced some opposition leaders to flee the country and jailed those who stayed. But Lukashenko has been able to hold on thanks in large part to staunch backing from Russia, his closest ally, which has publicly endorsed his victory, promised security support and agreed to provide $1.5 billion in loans.
