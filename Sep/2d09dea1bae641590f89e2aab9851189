Only about 20% of users are paying e-tolls, the Sunday Times said. If canceled, Sanral’s debt related to the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project will jump from around 40 billion rand ($2.4 billion) to 67 billion rand. South Africa’s lockdown to curb coronavirus cost Sanral more than 620 million rand, the Sunday Times said.
