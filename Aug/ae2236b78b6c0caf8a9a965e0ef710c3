The government said it’s enforcing the decision in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Ships won’t be allowed to sail with more than 50% their full capacity, or a maximum of 200 people, according to a statement on Friday. The rule is effective until Nov. 1, and follows an outbreak on a vessel operated by Hurtigruten Group AS.
