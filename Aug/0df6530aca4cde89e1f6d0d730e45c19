The rand often gets whipsawed by turbulence in the lira, but this time, the South African currency is leaving its Turkish peer behind. Even as the lira trades near a record low amid a depletion of foreign-exchange reserves and weak monetary-policy credibility, the rand is heading for its ninth gain in 10 days, crossing its 50-day moving average. Thatâ€™s a signal traders are treating the lira as an isolated case in emerging markets, while favoring the rand after South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago signaled the policy-easing cycle may be over.
