South Korea is gearing up for another year of record bond issuance as the government prepares to boost its budget by 8.5% in 2021. The finance ministry will issue as much as 172.9 trillion won ($145.6 billion) of sovereign debt in 2021, based on its budget proposal, according to An Il-whan, the Second Vice Minister of the Finance Ministry. This would eclipse the 167 trillion won planned for 2020, which came as the impact of the coronavirus forced policy makers to compile three supplementary budgets. It was initially envisaged that issuance this year would be 130.2 trillion won. The deluge of supply coming to market is already putting pressure on the nation’s bonds, which weakened in August. Governor Lee Ju-yeol last week damped hopes that the Bank of Korea would step up purchases anytime soon. Of the total amount planned for 2021, 63.2 trillion won would be used to repay maturing debt, according to a ministry official who asked not be named. This would mean net new issuance of 109.7 trillion won. Up to 89.7 trillion won would be issued as deficit-financing debt, while up to $1.5 billion would be foreign-exchange stabilization bonds, another official said. The officials asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the details. The government will submit its 555.8 trillion won budget bill to parliament on Thursday. The final size of the budget and bond sales will be released after approval from lawmakers, which is expected later this year. — With assistance by Whanwoong Choi
