California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state is seeing progress “across the spectrum” in its virus fight, even as wildfires raging in the San Francisco Bay Area spur evacuations and affect testing. The state reported 4,946 new cases Monday, a 0.7% increase and well below the 14-day average of 7,622. There were 18 additional deaths, compared with its two-week daily average of 128, but those figures tend to be lower on Mondays because of delays in reporting over the weekend. Hospitalizations from the virus decreased 2.1% to 4,467 patients, the lowest since late June, and are down 20% over a 14-day period, Newsom said at a briefing. The average rate of positive tests over the past week has reached 5.6%, compared with more than 7% last month. Newsom said virus testing has been disrupted by the wildfires, with 11 state labs “impacted very directly” by the blazes. Still, the state is testing more than 100,000 people a day. South Africa is “over the plateau” in its outbreak, said Salim Abdool Karim, the chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on the virus, said durin ga briefing Monday.
