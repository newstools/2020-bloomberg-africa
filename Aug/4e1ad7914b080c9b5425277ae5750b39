Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister, has been hospitalized with a serious case of coronavirus. Currently an opposition politician, she’s the most high-profile figure in the country to have contracted Covid-19 amid a surge in cases. The Sunday announcement was made on Facebook by her spokeswoman, Maryna Soroka. The 59-year-old garnered worldwide attention as a leader of the Orange Revolution back in 2004, before being imprisoned. Last year, she tried for a third time --with no luck -- to get elected as the nation’s president. Dismissed by some as a populist, she retains a base of hardcore support.
