Sweden’s government raised its economic forecast and promised to ramp up spending as part of an historic package designed to accelerate its recovery. The Social Democrat-led coalition will dedicate over 100 billion kronor ($11.5 billion) next year to dragging the Nordic region’s biggest economy out of its crisis. “To get Sweden out of the recession as quickly as possible we need a reboot of the Swedish economy,” Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson said in Stockholm on Thursday. “In 2022 we will still need forceful stimulus, perhaps also in 2023.” Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm, Aug. 27.

Gross domestic product is now expected to shrink 4.6% this year, compared to the 6% contraction seen in June. For next year, the government expects a stronger rebound than previously, with GDP set to grow 4.1%. “We can see signs of recovery even if the situation in the Swedish economy remains very serious,” Andersson said. Spending will target public investments across welfare and climate initiatives, she said. Andersson said Sweden has “an historic opportunity to take measures to create jobs, accelerate adjustments to climate change and improve social services.” This week, some of the biggest Nordic banks raised their GDP forecasts for Sweden, with the country now facing a much milder recession than the euro zone. What’s more, Sweden’s spending plans will leave debt well within limits set by the European Union. Next year, debt will reach 42% of GDP, compared with 35.2% in 2019. That’s less than half the EU average. “It’s not free money, it’s money that future generations need to repay, so we should be careful with tax payers’ money,” Andersson said.

That decision initially saw a spike in the number of Covid-related deaths and infections in Sweden, and the government of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has admitted that more should have been done to protect the elderly in care homes.
