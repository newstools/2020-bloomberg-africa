India had its biggest single-day jump in new coronavirus cases on Thursday, with 75,760 infections confirmed, as the disease’s spread continues to accelerate through the world’s second most populous country. With 3.3 million cases in total India currently has the world’s third largest outbreak, though its epidemic is now growing faster than both the U.S. and Brazil’s, the countries that have the most and second-most cases. Indian infections have continued to accelerate as the disease spreads out of its globally connected cities which were first hit, and into the country’s vast hinterland where most of the population lives. India’s new case tally on Thursday is its first 24-hour period to rival some of the worst days of the pandemic seen in both the U.S. and Brazil. Germany recorded 1,431 new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours through Thursday morning, little changed from the previous day’s figure of 1,457, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That brought the total to 239,010. The reproduction factor -- the average number of people infected by one person with the virus -- fell to 0.85 on Wednesday from 0.90 the previous day. A spat has broken out between senior officials in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc over coronavirus rules for travelers arriving in Germany from areas designated as risky. Health Minister Jens Spahn announced this week that arrivals from risk areas will have to enter a 14-day quarantine, which can be ended after five days if a negative test result is provided. Due to a lack of capacity, a requirement for people to be tested on arrival will be scrapped when the changes take effect some time after the middle of next month. Further details will be discussed when Merkel holds talks with leaders from Germany’s 16 states later on Thursday, as officials try to deal with an uptick in infections in Europe’s biggest economy in recent weeks. Switzerland’s economy saw less damage from the coronavirus lockdown than its larger neighbors, recording a smaller-than-expected contraction in the second quarter. While gross domestic product fell 8.2% in the three months through June, the most since at least 1980, the decline was less than the 9.7% in Germany and the double digit slumps in France and Italy. Airlines in the Asia Pacific region carried only 844,000 passengers on international flights in July versus 33.4 million in the same month last year due to border closures and travel restrictions, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. That’s a fall of 97%. Demand for international cargo was relatively stable following a modest recovery in global manufacturing, though freight tonne kilometers were still down 16% on an annual basis, the association said. Several states and industry bodies are evaluating Covid-19 testing regimes that could facilitate international air travel without blanket quarantine requirements, AAPA Director General Subhas Menon said. The Thai government may allow foreigners who own properties in the country to return as it seeks to gradually ease travel curbs imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Foreigners who plan long stays in Thailand may also be allowed, Natthapol Nakpanich, deputy army chief and a member of the national Covid-19 task force, told reporters in Bangkok Thursday. The easing of entry rules may see hundreds of foreign visitors entering Thailand, Natthapol said. Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said a jump in virus cases from July and heavy rains are dragging on the nation’s economy and he didn’t know yet whether the outbreak has peaked. He told a parliamentary committee the economy’s overall recovery trend is not yet back. Nishimura said on Wednesday a second wave of the virus now spreading in Japan is bigger than the one that caused the government to declare a state of emergency in April. South Korea had 441 more coronavirus cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, the biggest gain since early March, according to data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. That compared to 320 the previous day. Of the new cases, 154 were confirmed in Seoul, 100 in Gyeonggi province and 59 in Incheon. Vice Finance Minister Kim Yongbeom said he believed that the nation can handle the resurgence of the coronavirus with current social distancing rules. Still, so-called Level 3 rules would be needed if the situation worsens, he added at a briefing. A World Health Organization team that was meant to investigate the origin of the coronavirus concluded their trip to China without a visit to Wuhan, the Financial Times reported, citing the UN agency. The WHO told the FT that its advance team had remote conversations with senior scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology but declined to comment on whether the team had planned to visit the city.The organization said the initial team had been laying groundwork before a larger international investigation but didn’t provide details on whether the bigger task-force would travel to Wuhan. China’s foreign ministry called concerns over the credibility of the inquiry “totally unjustified,” according to the FT. Singapore will offer Covid-19 tests for travelers to China prior to departure, in an effort to align with new Chinese requirements aimed at stemming the growing number of imported virus cases. The new travel rules were instituted after China earlier registered dozens of passengers arriving from the Singapore who tested positive for the coronavirus. In response, the world’s second largest economy had temporarily suspended a number of flights from Singapore as a precautionary measure. Texas virus deaths rose by 229, a number that has remained persistently high as new cases and hospitalizations have declined since July. A total of 11,805 people have died from Covid-19, according to state death certificate data, since the outbreak began. Cases climbed to 592,137 after the state added another 5,507 to the tally Wednesday, including some backlogged data. Hospitalizations declined to 4,806, continuing a two-month downward trend. A 15-minute Covid test from Abbott Laboratories that will be priced at just $5 won emergency authorization for use in the U.S., a breakthrough that could ease the bottleneck that has crimped much of the nation’s testing capacity. The product, dubbed BinaxNOW, works without relying on laboratory equipment at a time when labs can take as long as two weeks to produce results. It uses a nasal swab and a small reactive card, and it can be administered by a range of health-care workers, including pharmacists, at almost any location. Abbott will start shipping the test within two weeks and intends to manufacture 50 million tests a month by the end of October.

(Source: Bloomberg) Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. top infectious disease doctor, told CNN that he is concerned that the CDC’s new coronavirus testing guidelines will make people believe “that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern, when in fact it is.” Fauci said in the CNN interview that he was in surgery when the new testing recommendations were discussed.

(Source: Bloomberg) Phil Hogan Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg The European Union’s trade chief, Phil Hogan, stepped down after growing criticism that he broke virus regulations in his native Ireland. Hogan was under pressure over his attendance at a golf dinner last week that violated coronavirus regulations as well as his behavior during quarantine upon arrival in his home country. The resignation came a day after Ireland’s government said that Hogan’s “delayed and hesitant” response impaired public confidence. Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.8% as compared with the same time Tuesday to 5.8 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase matched the average daily gain over the past week. Deaths rose by 0.8% to 179,150. France reported 5,429 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, a four-month high that comes after similarly important surges in recent days. Prime Minister Jean Castex will hold a press conference on Thursday to address the health situation as infections rise. Greece reported a record-high 293 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 9280. The number is the highest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The average age of people who tested positive is 39. The country also recorded five new deaths, bringing the total to 248. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said the state won’t follow recent guidance on the coronavirus from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling it “political propaganda.” The CDC this week said that people who have potentially been exposed to the virus and are asymptomatic don’t need to be tested. The agency, contrary to its previous recommendations, also said that people traveling from hot spots no longer need to self-quarantine for 14 days. “We’re not going to follow the CDC guidance,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said on a conference call with the media. The CDC reversed its guidance to say that people in close contact with a COVID-positive person don't need to get tested.This is not science. It’s politics. Politics that are dangerous to public health.It's indefensible. He accused Republican President Donald Trump of using the agency to “forward his political agenda,” saying it’s “frightening and it is alarming.” Italy recorded 1,367 new cases Wednesday, the highest number in three months and a half, on the day the government ruled out a new lockdown. Many of the new infections involve Italians returning from vacations either within the country or abroad. The Lombardy region said two out of three of the latest cases are holidaymakers returning from outside of Italy. In response to the surge, Italy is ramping up testing in ports and airports, with a record 93,529 tests carried out Wednesday. Still, the health minister said the country is ruling out a new nationwide lockdown. People returning from Sardinia by ferry undergoes a compulsory swab test on Aug. 23. Photographer: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP via Getty Images Moscow is inviting all its residents to participate in Phase 3 testing of a Covid-19 vaccine that was approved for use earlier this month, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on his blog Wednesday. Russia approved the use of the Sputnik V vaccine, which Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute is developing with the sovereign Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Defense Ministry, before it finished clinical trials. The testing will continue even as medical workers are vaccinated. Many members of the local elite, including one of President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, have already been inoculated. The capital accounts for more than a quarter of Russia’s nearly 1 million cases. Moderna Inc. presented new safety data from an early trial that provides the first evidence that its Covid-19 vaccine stimulates the immune systems of older people. In a phase 1 trial, Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine produced “consistently high levels” of neutralizing antibodies -- a key component of the body’s protective response -- in older adults, the company said in a statement. Antibody levels produced in people more than 55 years old were comparable to those seen in younger adults, the company said in a statement. The findings are important because older adults often don’t respond as well to vaccines as younger adults. — With assistance by Mark Schoifet
