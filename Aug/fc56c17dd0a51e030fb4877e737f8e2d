Lido beach in Mogadishu. Dozens remain trapped in a luxury hotel in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, following an attack by gunmen on the beach-side property that has killed at least five people. The attackers blew up a vehicle loaded with explosives before fighting their way into the newly built Elite hotel, located at the edge of Lido beach, an area frequented by senior officials. Two government officials were among the dead, state spokesman Ismael Mukhtar Omar said, adding that a military operation was now underway to rescue people from the hotel. “We also counted 19 others injured in the attack,” he told Bloomberg over the phone, adding that two of the attackers had been killed. Al-Shabaab, a militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack.
