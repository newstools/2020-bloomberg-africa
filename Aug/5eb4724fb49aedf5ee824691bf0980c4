The benchmark South African index showcased broad-based weakness, led by the country’s biggest listed companies, Naspers Ltd., BHP Plc, and Richemont, which account for 39% of market capitalization. Of the 150 listed companies, 79 were lower in early trade, while a further 30 were unchanged. Iron ore miners slid while gold producers gained amid inreased demand for bullion. Friday’s losses trim the benchmark index’s weekly gains to 0.8%. South African stocks remain on course for a fifth month of gains, with one session left for August.
