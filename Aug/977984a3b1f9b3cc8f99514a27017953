Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. could reach almost 310,000 by Dec. 1, according to projections by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. In two other scenarios, universal mask wearing could reduce deaths to about 241,000, and eased restrictions could push the toll as high as 421,000. IHME, funded partly by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was influential in the early days of the pandemic, including within the Trump administration. The institute was criticized by some as too optimistic and says it has updated its modeling since. Outbreaks in California, Florida, Arizona and Texas have “peaked or stabilized,” according to the latest analysis, while nationwide deaths have “stayed quite steady” at about 1,000 a day. France reported 3,602 new cases after two consecutive days with more than 4,000, though infections remain at levels last seen in May, according to government data. Deaths increased by nine to 30,512, the fewest in six days. The toll compares with more than 1,000 deaths on several days in April at the peak of France’s virus crisis. Italy reported 1,071 cases, the first time since mid-May the country has registered more than 1,000 new infections. As many Italians return from holidays abroad and some of the country’s vacation spots popular with foreigners have been near capacity, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government has shut down nightclubs and required face coverings in public at night. Italy has struggled to institute virus testing at airports and critics say Conte’s governing coalition hasn’t provided a clear plan for reopening schools next month. Arizona reported 996 cases, a 0.5% rise that’s more than the average 0.4% daily increase of the previous week. The total, in a hard-hit state which is now improving, is 197,895. Another 68 deaths were reported, up from 4 the previous day. Total deaths, which peaked at 105 over the last week, are now 4,756. The U.K. had the most new cases since June as the country continues to step up testing. Infections rose by 1,288 to 324,601, according to government data. That’s the most since June 20 and above the previous seven-day average of 992. Deaths increased by 18 to 41,423. Florida reported 597,597 cases on Saturday, a 0.7% rise compared with the average increase of 0.8% in the previous seven days. The state added 4,311 new cases. Deaths among Florida residents reached 10,274, an increase of 106 compared with 119 the previous day and below the average daily increase of the previous week, according to the state health department report, which includes data through Friday. New York reported 653 cases, little changed from the average 0.1% daily increase of the previous seven days. Another four deaths were reported, and hospitalizations fell to 483, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a tweet. U.S. cases rose 47,581 on Friday, an 0.9% increase that matches the average daily rise of the previous seven days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.

At least 41 schools in Berlin have reported that students or teachers have become infected with Covid-19, less than two weeks after schools in Germany’s capital reopened, the AP reports. Hundreds of students and teachers are in quarantine, the Berliner Zeitung newspaper reported. Berlin was one of the first places in Germany to reopen its schools after the summer holidays. Europe’s renewed surge in Covid-19 cases appears to be less deadly than the original wave several months ago, data show. Increased testing is catching the disease earlier, and in contrast to spikes in March and April -- when the pandemic ripped through nursing homes -- authorities are doing a better job of protecting the elderly and other vulnerable people, according to scientists. However, others caution that as infections in most European countries began climbing only a few days or weeks ago, deaths could rise again too given the lag between infection and death.

The new data show the most loan approvals in July and August were for personal-services firms, general freight and trucking companies and beauty salons.
