British e-commerce company The Hut Group Ltd. said it plans to sell 920 million pounds ($1.2 billion) of new shares in an initial public offering, breathing life into an IPO market that has seen little activity this year. Holders of existing shares also will reduce their stakes, the company said, without detailing the size of this portion of the offering. The Hut Group intends to have a free float of at least 20% of the company’s share capital and a fixed offer price equating to a pre-money equity value of 4.5 billion pounds. At 920 million pounds, the listing would be the largest by a British company in London since online rail-ticketing company Trainline Plc debuted in June 2019. The Hut Group operates websites including myprotein.com and Coggles.com that sell beauty and nutrition products. IPO activity has been hampered by the economic effect of the coronavirus pandemic and volatile markets. Only seven companies have managed to go public in London this year, a 65% drop on the same period in 2019 and the lowest since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The IPO market is slowly picking up pace once again, but the only companies that have been able to list are those that benefited from, or proved resilient to, the impact of virus-induced lockdowns. The Hut Group said its growth has accelerated this year, with revenue climbing nearly 36% to 676 million pounds in the six-month period ending June 30, from a year ago. Growth trends across the company’s beauty and nutrition markets are underpinned by consumers becoming more comfortable buying online and valuing the variety and convenience offered by e-commerce, it said. Besides retailing its own brands in beauty and nutrition, the company markets third-party brands, via its technology platform. The Hut Group’s shareholders include its founder, Chief Executive Officer Matthew Moulding, and other members of management, plus Old Mutual Global Investors, funds managed by BlackRock Inc., Sofina, Merian Chrysalis Investments, Balderton and KKR & Co. JPMorgan Cazenove, Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Jefferies and Numis are arranging the deal.
