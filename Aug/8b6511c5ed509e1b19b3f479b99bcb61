Investors may be able to scoop up Germany’s first green bonds for cheap next week as Europe’s debt issuance intensifies following the summer trading lull. The nation could issue 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) of green debt, according to Commerzbank AG. Yields would be set partly against regular 10-year peers that just had their biggest weekly rise in nearly three months, and topped up with a premium from the Treasury. Euro-area bond yields climbed this week and curves steepened as economic indicators improved, signaling optimism that the recovery is on track. They’ve also been propelled upward by the Federal Reserve’s shift to a more relaxed approach on inflation. Yet the green bonds could see their price increase, said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “Many green investors are buying bonds as buy-to-hold and the European Central Bank is also keen to increase its green footprint via its purchase programs,” he wrote in a client note. “All this argues for a higher scarcity value.” Italy may also issue syndicated debt for the first time since June, according to Danske Bank A/S, when the nation saw record orders for such a sale. Such offerings would seek to take advantage of coupons and payments on over 50 billion euros of bonds payable next week by Italy and Germany, which investors will then need to reinvest. Euro-area bond sales including inflation-linked notes are due from Germany, France and Spain next week and set to total around 22 billion euros, according to Danske. The bank also expects Germany to sell its inaugural 10-year green bond via banks, and Italy to issue a long-maturity note for 10 billion euros.
