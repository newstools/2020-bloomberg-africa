Australia’s household debt, among the highest in the developed world, could exacerbate a severe economic downturn by forcing a pullback in consumption, a Reserve Bank research report showed. “We find that a severe stress scenario would have a somewhat larger effect on consumer spending today than it would have had a decade or two earlier,” according to the report, lead-authored by Jonathan Kearns, head of financial stability at the RBA.
