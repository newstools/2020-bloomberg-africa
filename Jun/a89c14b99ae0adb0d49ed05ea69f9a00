Florida reported its biggest one-day increase in coronavirus cases. The state had a total of 132,545 Covid-19 cases as of Saturday, up 7.8% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 4.6% in the previous seven days. The one-day increase of 9,585 was the most ever. Deaths among Florida residents reached 3,390, an increase of 0.7%, according to the report, which includes data through Friday. Cumulative hospitalizations of Florida residents rose 1.1% to 14,136. Florida is among Sun Belt states such as Texas, Arizona and California, where cases have been spiking in the past week, prompting officials to slow business reopenings. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said late Friday that the city’s popular beaches would be shut for the Independence Day holiday weekend. The five-day suspension starting July 3 would be extended “if conditions do not improve,” Gimenez said in a statement. Miami-Dade County reported 917 patients with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals as of Saturday, a decline of 77 from a day earlier. The number of patients in intensive-care unit beds rose to 197 from 195, according to a report from the county, which is Florida’s most populous. Still, today’s report didn’t include hospitalizations from two facilities that reported more than 100 admissions on Friday, suggesting the apparent drop could be due to a distortion. The county has 2,728 acute-care beds available, a drop of 183 from the previous day, and 436 ICU beds, a decline of 15. The number of Covid-19 patients on ventilators fell to 84 from 85 a day earlier. The median age of cases among Florida residents was 34, the same as the previous day. The new rate of people testing positive for the first time was 12.8% on Friday, from 12.9% on Thursday. — With assistance by Jonathan Levin
