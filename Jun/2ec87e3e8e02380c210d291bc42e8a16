Justice Minister Celestin Tunda Ya Kasende was detained by police on Saturday and released after questioning. Tunda is an ally of Ilunga and former President Joseph Kabila and is in a coalition government with supporters of current President Felix Tshisekedi. Kabila’s allies control most of the government’s ministries and both chambers of parliament. “This serious and unprecedented incident is of a nature that will weaken the stability and the harmonious functioning of institutions, and provoke the government’s resignation,” Ilunga said in a statement published on his office’s website on Sunday. Congo’s parliament is considering a proposal that could give the justice ministry more oversight over the country’s judiciary. The measure has led to demonstrations by Tshisekedi’s supporters and was criticized last week in a joint statement by the U.S., U.K., and Canadian embassies as having the potential “to undermine an independent judiciary.” Tshisekedi’s spokesman declined to comment on the minister’s detention.
