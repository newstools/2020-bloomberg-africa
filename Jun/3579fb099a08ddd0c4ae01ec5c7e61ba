Even so, the projected growth of 1.9% will be the least since 2003, when the country was in the grip of famine, and will follow more than a decade of annual expansion of around 10%. Kenya, the regionâ€™s third-largest economy, is now expected to contract for the first time in 27 years, compared with an April estimate of 1% growth.
