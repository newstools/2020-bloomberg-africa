An emergency meeting of the party’s national executive committee attended by Buhari decided to appoint a caretaker committee to manage its affairs while directing members to end all current litigations. The APC was forged out of three main opposition parties and a faction of the former ruling People’s Democratic Party in 2014, creating a platform that successfully wrested power at the ballot a year later with Buhari as its candidate. Factional differences appear to be increasing as interest groups position themselves ahead of elections in 2023, when Buhari will complete his second and final term.
