Anders Tegnell, the architect of Sweden’s hands-off response to fighting the coronavirus pandemic, said the WHO made a “total mistake” by putting the Nordic nation on a list that shows where “accelerated transmission has led to very significant resurgence that, if left unchecked, will push health systems to the brink once again in Europe.” The list, which includes just 11 countries, fails to take into consideration the nuances in Sweden’s approach to testing, according to Tegnell. “We have an increased number of cases since we started testing a lot more in Sweden last week,” he told Swedish public radio on Friday. “But we can look at all other parameters we measure, that is how many serious cases we have; they’re decreasing.” Tegnell said a key indicator to watch is the number of admissions to intensive care units, which he characterized as being at a very low level in Sweden. He also noted that the death rate is on the decline. “So this is unfortunately a total misjudgment of the Swedish data,” Tegnell said. Sweden has one of the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality rates, with more deaths per 100,000 than the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University data. Still, at no point has Sweden’s Covid crisis overburdened its state-funded universal health-care system. Deaths per 100,000 population Source: Johns Hopkins University Note: Data as of June 24
