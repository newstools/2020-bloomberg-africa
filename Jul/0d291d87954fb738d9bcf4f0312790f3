Th Congress of South African Trade Unions, which is in an alliance to the ruling African National Congress, objects to taxis being filled at a time when the number of coronavirus infections is surging, it said in an emailed statement Friday. The government this week increased the number of passengers taxis can carry to 100% from 70% in urban areas, as it adjusted regulations introduced to curb the spread of the virus. The decision followed a threat by the taxi operators to flout any restrictions on them.
