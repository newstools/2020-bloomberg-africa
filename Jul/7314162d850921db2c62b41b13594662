Amid massive job losses, a looming tsunami of evictions and a pathogen that thrives on mass gatherings, the pandemic has created unprecedented policy challenges for addressing homelessness in America. By one estimate, the nation’s unhoused population could spike by as much as 45% by the end of the year. Some local governments have implemented stop-gap measures to keep people off the streets, including eviction moratoriums and temporary housing in vacant hotels. But a long-term solution requires understanding the complex history of homelessness in the U.S., its rise alongside cities and the multiple forces behind the current housing instability. In the latest edition of CityLab University, contributor Benjamin Schneider breaks down the fundamentals of America’s long-ignored social problem, as well as the debates over how to solve it. Today on CityLab: Understanding Homelessness in America -Linda Poon It’s Time to Try Congestion Pricing in L.A.
