The National Resistance Movement’s electoral commission’s chairman, Tanga Odoi, said Museveni fulfilled all party requirements and is the ideal candidate having created and sustained a stable environment for the country. The 75-year-old leader of Africa’s biggest coffee exporter has assured voters that another term in office will see his government intensify the drive to modernization and wealth creation. Museveni became eligible for re-election after lawmakers, most of them members of his NRM party, abolished an upper age limit for presidential candidates. Pop star-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi, who goes by the stage name Bobi Wine, and former security minister Henry Tumukunde are among those who intend to challenge Museveni.
