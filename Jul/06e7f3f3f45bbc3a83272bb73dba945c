Nigerian inflation accelerated for the 10th straight month in June as restrictions on access to foreign exchange and continued border closures drove up prices. Consumer prices climbed 12.6% from a year earlier, compared with 12.4% in May, Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said in a report published Friday on it website. That matched the median of four economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Costs rose 1.2% in the month. — With assistance by Monique Vanek, and Simbarashe Gumbo
