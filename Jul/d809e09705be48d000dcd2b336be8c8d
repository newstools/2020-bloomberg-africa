Washington (AP) -- Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was hospitalized for “minor, non-coronavirus related issues,” a department spokesperson said Saturday. Ross, 82, is “doing well” and is expected to be released from the hospital soon, the spokesperson said in a statement. The department did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. Ross, a former banker known for acquiring and restructuring failed companies, was confirmed as commerce secretary in February 2017.
