German Chancellor Angela Merkel showed a united front with Italy’s Giuseppe Conte days ahead of a crucial European Union summit, warning that EU leaders need to deliver a “massive” response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The German leader’s common line with the Italian prime minister was a sales pitch in favor of a proposed 750 billion-euro ($853 billion) recovery plan, which has met with resistance from a handful of member states concerned by the cost. “It has to be something special -- and it can’t be dwarfed” in size by horse-trading compromises, Merkel told reporters outside Berlin alongside Conte. “The task is a huge one, so the response also has to be a big one.” EU leaders will gather in Brussels on Friday for the first time since the pandemic swept the continent.

She’ll host the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, at the chancellery on Tuesday. — With assistance by Raymond Colitt
