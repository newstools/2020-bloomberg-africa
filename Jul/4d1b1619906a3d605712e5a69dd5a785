Suburban consensus: America is a nation of suburbs, yet there’s no standard definition as to what constitutes one. Some define a suburb as a town on the periphery of a larger city; others say it’s a sprawling neighborhood of single-family homes. Still others use the outdated characterization of suburbs as being mostly white, middle class and socially homogenous. So how can researchers help Americans come closer to consensus? By talking to a lot of them. Using data from a survey of 55,000 people, a group of experts that include economist Jed Kolko (who has been tackling this question for some time) built a model that analyzes which factors (such as population density, demographics and location) best predict how people decide if their neighborhood is urban, rural or suburban. The results reveal some of the misconceptions in our past definitions. Today in CityLab: How to Tell If You Live in the Suburbs -Linda Poon Nashville’s Downtown Tests the City-Within-a-City Concept Downtown Nashville will soon be home to Tennessee’s biggest mixed-use development.
