Sparse visitors walkÂ on the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town, on June 15. South African retail sales dropped by double digits in April and May as lockdown restrictions limited the goods that could be sold and caused job and income losses as businesses were forced to close. Sales plunged 50.4% in April from a year earlier, before recovering slightly to fall 12% in May, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said Wednesday in a report on its website. The April drop in sales is the most on record.
