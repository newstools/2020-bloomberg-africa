Workers are asking that their pay be based off what they were earning in 2018, Shepard Ngandu, assistant secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Banks and Allied Workers’ Union, said by phone on Monday. Receiving pay in the local currency is of no value because of the dollarization seen in the economy, he said. The country is struggling with food and fuel shortages, an annual inflation rate of about 786%, and a local currency that has imploded since being reintroduced last year after a decade-long hiatus.
