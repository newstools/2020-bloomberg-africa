Russian incomes in the second quarter plunged by the most since the country’s 1998 default as the economy of the world’s biggest energy exporter took a double blow from the pandemic and slump in global oil demand.

The coronavirus upended a plan to boost spending on social projects this year, with completion of the so-called National Projects likely pushed back until 2030. The plunge hammered retail sales, which fell 7.7% in June after a 19% drop in April. Wages rebounded in May after a drop in April, climbing 1%. Unemployment edged up to 6.2% in June from 6.1% in May. “The worst is over, but the rebound in demand faces a low ceiling until the virus is under control. Even then, persistent weakness in incomes is likely to weigh on consumption.” --Scott Johnson, Bloomberg Economics Industrial production contracted for a third month in June even as lockdown measures were being lifted in many regions, falling 9.4% from a year before, after a 9.6% drop in May, the statistics agency reported Thursday.
