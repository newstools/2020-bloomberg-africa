Australia’s Victoria state recorded 532 new Covid-19 cases Monday as authorities struggle to bring a second wave of infections under control. The daily tally announced Monday follows the 459 new cases reported the previous day in Victoria, and is a new national record. There were six additional fatalities, State Premier Daniel Andrews said at a press conference. Authorities are battling to contain a fresh wave of infections after about 5 million people in Melbourne were plunged back into lockdown more than two weeks ago. Almost three-quarters of the state’s 8,696 infections have occurred since the restrictions were reinforced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Last week, he announced plans for a A$300 ($214) payment to encourage those feeling unwell to get tested and self-isolate. “Lockdown will not end until people stop going to work with symptoms,” he told reporters. “Unless we see a change, then we’re going to continue to see these numbers at unacceptably high levels.” The shutdown of the nation’s second-biggest city, which contributes about one-quarter of gross domestic product, could prolong the nation’s first recession in almost three decades. Australia’s government forecasts Melbourne’s renewed restrictions reducing national real GDP growth by about A$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion), or around three-quarters of a percentage point, in the September quarter of 2020. New South Wales state reported a further 17 cases in the past 24 hours, according to the state health agency.
