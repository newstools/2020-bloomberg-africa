U.S. stocks eked out a third straight gain, though finished well off session highs after Senator Mitch McConnell cast doubt on reaching a fresh rescue bill before some current benefits expire. The S&P 500 rode a rally in energy and financial stocks to a fresh four-month high. Its advance was checked when the Senate majority leader told Politico he doesn’t expect a bill to pass within two weeks. Stocks were higher for most of the session after European Union leaders clinched a rescue package. That also sent the euro to the highest since 2019. “We are very likely getting a deal, but we should also expect dramatic headlines and the volatility associated with them,” said Dennis DeBusschere, a strategist at Evercore ISI. Tech shares led declines a day after the biggest rally since April. Corporate earnings and positive vaccine news had boosted sentiment. Texas Instruments reported earnings after the close. Oil surged, lifting Exxon Mobil and Chevron in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq 100 edged lower after closing at an all-time high, with investors awaiting a spate of megacap tech earnings later this week. The gauge has surged 25% in 2020, in large part to a meteoric advance in Amazon.com Inc., which added $117 billion to its market value just on Monday.
