Minors involved in growing the chocolate ingredient rose from 16% to 19.4% of the children living in more than 1,400 households surveyed between March 17 and May 15, according to data released Wednesday by the International Cocoa Initiative. The report described the rise as “concerning.” “Stakeholders in the cocoa sector should consider taking additional action to address the negative impact of the (health) crisis on cocoa households and their children,” it said. The report’s authors couldn’t say with certainty that the lockdown was behind the increase in child labor. However, schools were closed soon after the country confirmed its first coronavirus case on March 11. Ivory Coast had 9,214 cases on June 29, including 66 deaths.
