The agriculture, transport, health and animal resources ministers were also changed, the state news agency SUNA reported. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok named seven acting ministers until a new administration is formed. The Finance Ministry will be run by Heba Ahmed Ali, Omar Ismail Gamar Aldin was given the foreign affairs portfolio and Khairy Abdel Rahman will lead the Energy Ministry. The move comes after the Sudanese Revolutionary Front, a coalition of rebel groups, visited the capital, Khartoum, to finalize a peace pact with the transitional government. The leadership of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North has said the insurgents are set to take ministerial positions. The overthrow of long-term dictator Omar al-Bashir last year has sparked fresh hopes that the conflicts in the western region of Darfur and two southern states could finally be resolved. Bashir, who treated insurgencies with an iron fist during his three-decade rule, was indicted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes for his role in Darfur. Sudan, Africa’s third-largest country, is being run by an uneasy coalition of civilian and military figures as it prepares for democratic elections slated for 2022.
