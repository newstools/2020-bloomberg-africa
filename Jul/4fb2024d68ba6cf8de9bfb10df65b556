The company announced in June it planned to eliminate 3,000 U.K. jobs this year. While more than that number applied for voluntary severance, the company will still have to make enforced cutbacks in some areas, according to a spokeswoman. Rolls-Royce has been hit by a drop in demand for engines after Covid-19 sparked a deep recession in the aerospace industry. The first wave of cutbacks will see the London-based company emerge from the pandemic as a much smaller business. Chief Executive Officer Warren East warned earlier this month it will take several years for the civil aviation industry to recover. Rolls-Royce’s aerospace business will likely be about one-third smaller, and there will be a charge on its dollar-hedging book to reflect the downsizing, he said. The British industrial icon is taking other measures to cut costs as the pandemic cripples demand for long-range aircraft, while also hitting demand for profitable maintenance services. It’s looking at raising equity and divesting units, as well as seeking to save hundreds of millions of pounds by closing its final salary pension plan to future contributions four years early.
