Egyptian stocks have attracted the attention of Azimut Holding SpA, with the $61 billion money manager targeting the North African country’s diaspora through a new equity fund. Azimut’s Luxembourg-based fund will initially allocate $50 million between as many as 25 Cairo-traded stocks. Egypt’s 100-million population and the purchasing power of its consumers have the potential to fuel growth for companies as the economy emerges from its coronavirus lockdown, according to Ahmed Abou El Saad, managing director of the Italian firm’s local unit. Egypt has already proved an investor darling in the bond market. The country in late 2016 negotiated a three-year International Monetary Fund deal, securing a $12 billion loan as it steeply devalued its currency and cut subsidies. The moves helped rekindle appetite for the debt, battered in the aftermath of the 2011 uprising. Milan-based Azimut is testing whether equity investors are ready to follow suit. After a hit to equities this year that was more than five times worse than the average for emerging markets, valuations on Cairo stocks are relatively inexpensive, Abou El Saad said. That may draw investors, including thousands of Egyptians who work abroad and may be keen to increase their exposure to the market, he said.
