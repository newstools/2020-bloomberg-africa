Donald Trump President Donald Trump blasted the U.S. Supreme Court over a pair of rulings involving his financial records, depicting himself as the victim of a double standard that isn’t applied to his political enemies. “This is all a political prosecution,” Trump said Thursday on Twitter, where he repeated his attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!” The Supreme Court allowed a New York grand jury to obtain the president’s financial records, while blocking for now House subpoenas that could have resulted in their release before the November election. Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow had a far more positive reaction, saying he was “pleased” that the court “temporarily blocked both Congress and New York prosecutors from obtaining the President’s financial records.” He added that Trump’s legal team would raise additional objections to their release in lower courts. Yet the Supreme Court’s rejection of Trump’s claim of “absolute immunity” appeared to anger the president, who accused the court of singling him out for political reasons. “We have a totally corrupt previous Administration, including a President and Vice President who spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAIGHT...and nothing happens to them,” he tweeted. “Now the Supreme Court gives a delay ruling that they would never have given.......for another President.” Courts in the past have given “broad deference”. BUT NOT ME! He also took aim at the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee and federal law enforcement, saying they haven’t done enough to investigate former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential race. “No Republican Senate Judiciary response, NO ‘JUSTICE’, NO FBI, NO NOTHING,” Trump wrote.
