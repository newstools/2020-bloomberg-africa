Residents in Australia’s second-biggest city must wear face masks as parts of the nation struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak. From Thursday, people in Melbourne and Mitchell shire will face fines of A$200 ($140) if they are caught not obeying the mandatory  directive, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said Sunday. The state recorded 363 new cases, a jump from 217 on Saturday. Neighboring New South Wales state had 18 new cases. The risks from the latest jump in cases has seen the next planned sitting of Australia’s parliament set to be canceled. The nation’s two most-densely populated states are the greatest immediate concern among lawmakers and health officials. The state of emergency in Victoria will be extended through Aug. 16, allowing for the enforcement of the mask ruling and other public health directions from the state’s chief health officer, according to the government. There will be some exceptions from the mask rule, including for teachers when they are working and for people with medicals reasons. Victoria will also strengthen measures to protect the hospital and aged-care sectors. New South Wales will further cap overseas arrivals in Sydney at 350 passengers a day from Monday after a new agreement was reached with the federal government, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. The new limit is 100 passengers less than the previous cap, which was introduced on July 5.
