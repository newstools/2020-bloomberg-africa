The Supreme Court ruled that much of eastern Oklahoma is still American Indian territory in a decision that raises questions about the stateâ€™s authority to prosecute Native Americans and enforce regulations. The justices, voting 5-4, sided with a convicted child molester who argued that the state lacked authority to prosecute him because he is a Native American whose alleged crime took place within the boundaries of the Creek Nation reservation.
