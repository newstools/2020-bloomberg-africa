Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which produces almost all of its power from coal, is also seeking advice on mining and how to prioritize its budget allocation, according to documents accompanying a request for proposals that closes Aug. 20. “The objective is to form four different panels of financial advisers to provide services as and when needed,” the company said in a response to queries. Eskom, which has been repeatedly bailed out by the government, has debt of at least 454 billion rand ($27 billion) and is struggling to meet its running costs. It implemented rolling national blackouts this month because of plant breakdowns.
