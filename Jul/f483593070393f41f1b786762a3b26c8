The accord between Ethiopia and Eritrea ended a stalemate that followed after a 1998 to 2000 border war in which as many as 100,000 people died. Following the peace deal, the United Nations lifted decade-old sanctions on Eritrea. This week, the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on the country’s presidential adviser, Yemane Ghebreab. “The Eritrea-Ethiopia peace process is treading along in a complex domestic, regional and international climate that is fraught with risks and threats,” Eritrea said.
