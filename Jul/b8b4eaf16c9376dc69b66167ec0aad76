Fahim Saleh, the 33 year-old founder and chief executive officer of startup Gokada, was found dead Tuesday afternoon at his Manhattan condominium. Saleh’s body was found dismembered and decapitated near an electric saw that was still plugged into the wall, the New York Times reported. Officials told the newspaper that his sister discovered the body when she decided to go to Saleh’s building after a day without hearing from him. Gokada, a motorcycle ride-hailing business that operates in Nigeria, confirmed the death on Twitter.
