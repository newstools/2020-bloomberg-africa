Italy’s Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA is open to buying a controlling stake in Autostrade per l’Italia SpA in an initial public offering that would separate the toll-road operator from its parent company, Atlantia SpA, people familiar with the matter said. The proposals would allow the Italian state-backed lender and other investors to pay the market value for the holding, following investors’ concern about the price of the assets. The new proposal will now be reviewed by Atlantia. Still, TCI Fund Management Ltd., which owns more than 5% of Atlantia through a direct stake and swap contracts, poured cold water on the revised deal. “TCI strongly opposes any capital increase, or IPO at a discounted price,” TCI’s billionaire activist investor Christopher Hohn told Bloomberg News. TCI values Autostrade at about 11 billion to 12 billion euros ($12.8 billion to $14 billion) before any transaction. “The only way to ensure an entry of CDP in Autostrade that is fair for Atlantia and international investors, is a straight sale of Atlantia’s 88% stake in the unit through a competitive process led by reputable international intermediaries, or a spinoff at fair market price, with the Benetton’s stake being offered simultaneously to investors, including CDP,” TCI’s Jonathan Amouyal said. TCI wrote two letters to the Italian government earlier this month claiming that the nationalization of the toll-road manager is a “de facto illegitimate expropriation” of investors’ stakes. Atlantia wasn’t immediately available to comment. A representative for CDP declined to comment. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government and the Benetton family earlier this month agreed to settle a dispute on Autostrade’s highway licenses stemming from a deadly 2018 bridge disaster. Benetton-controlled Atlantia was forced by the Italian government to choose between a revocation of the toll-road concession and a sale of its stake in Autostrade. The price for Autostrade is a key to the plan and disagreement over the company’s valuation risks delaying its nationalization at a time when the rebuilt bridge in Genoa is about to be inaugurated. Atlantia and CDP have disagreed over the price, making it likely there will be a delay in signing a preliminary agreement that was expected on July 27, people familiar with the matter said last week. The government is keen to ensure investors see the operation as market friendly, an official said earlier this month. The person declined to be identified because the talks are confidential. The new plan for CDP’s intervention was first reported by Ansa.
