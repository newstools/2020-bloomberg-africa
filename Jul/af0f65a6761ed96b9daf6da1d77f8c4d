Rose Christiane Ossouka Raponda, who was defense minister, will name a cabinet in the coming days, a presidency statement said Thursday. This will be the fourth shakeup since an attempted coup in January 2019, which occurred while Bongo, 61, was in Saudi Arabia recovering from a stroke. Bongo has ruled the oil-producing nation since winning 2009 elections held months following his father’s demise. Omar Bongo died in office after 41 years in power.
