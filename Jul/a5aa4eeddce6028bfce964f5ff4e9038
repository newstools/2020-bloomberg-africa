The daily count of confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. is showing how the world’s largest economy is struggling to contain the pandemic. The seven-day average of fatalities topped 1,000 for the first time since early June on Monday and has stayed above that level, following last month’s spike in infections. On Wednesday, the country marked another grim milestone: More than 150,000 Americans have succumbed to the virus.
