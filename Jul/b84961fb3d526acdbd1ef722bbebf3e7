Gambian President Adama Barrow started to self-isolate Wednesday for two weeks after his deputy contracted the coronavirus disease. Vice President Isatou Touray, 65, tested positive for Covid-19, the presidency said in a Twitter post. A presidential spokeswoman couldn’t say if Barrow, 55, had been tested for the virus, when reached by phone in the capital, Banjul.
