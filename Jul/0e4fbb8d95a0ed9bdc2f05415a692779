Saied’s call, reported by independent radio station Mosaique FM on its website, came as a group of 105 lawmakers filed a formal no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh. The premier has come under fire for alleged conflict of interest. Fakhfakh came into office after a predecessor nominated by the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party failed to get the support of lawmakers after last year’s parliamentary vote. He inherited a country where partisan politics have stymied efforts to revive the economy. The prime minister has fought back, mainly targeting his detractors at  Ennahda. Fakhfakh announced earlier in the week that he would reshuffle the cabinet, looking to strip the party that holds the largest bloc of seats in the legislature of its portfolios. Ennahda has been criticized by its opponents in parliament of trying to usurp power and of being too close to Turkey and the Muslim Brotherhood.
