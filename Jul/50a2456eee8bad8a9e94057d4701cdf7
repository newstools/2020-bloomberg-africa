The cabinet approved a proposal of leasing five state-owned mills to operators for about 20 years, Agriculture Secretary Peter Munya said in a statement. The plan involves the government bailing out the factories from debt burdens that forced Miwani Sugar Company and Muhoroni Sugar Company into receivership. The entities could get debt relief of as much as 62 billion shillings ($581 million), the Standard newspaper reported on Friday, citing Munya. The move means President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration is dropping previous plans to sell off the mills, which together control a third of the nation’s sugar market. The other three are Chemelil Sugar Company, Nzoia Sugar Company and South Nyanza Sugar Company. “Leaseholders will be expected to revamp and modernize the sugar mills,” Munya said in an earlier statement handed to reporters. The government also banned the importation of cane and brown sugar, to avoid a potential glut and eventual collapse of the industry, according to Munya. The imports are “a great disincentive to farmers and investors,” he said.
