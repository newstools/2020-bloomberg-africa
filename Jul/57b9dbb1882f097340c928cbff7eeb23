Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, last year contracted the German engineering company to rehabilitate and expand its electricity grid. Only about two-thirds of Nigerians have access to power and even those are plagued by constant blackouts. Buhari, 76, granted “anticipatory approval” for 18.94 million Euros, or 15% of the cost, as counterpart funding for the project, Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said. The balance of 85% will be provided by Euler Hermes Group SAS, and backed by the German government, on concessionary terms with a three-year moratorium, a 12-year repayment period at “an interest rate of Libor-plus 1% to Libor-plus 1.2%.” The project will be implemented in three phases to be completed by 2025 when Nigeria estimates its on-grid transmission capacity would reach 25,000 megawatts. The West African nation has an installed capacity of 13,000 megawatts, from which only a daily average of 3,500 megawatts is dispatched to consumers due to a poor transmission and distribution network.
