JPMorgan Chase & Co. told employees worldwide that they will start working from home on a rotating basis, as the biggest U.S. bank intensifies its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Employees around the world will split their time between homes and offices on a one- or two-week rotation, JPMorgan said late Friday in a memo. The move expands upon earlier arrangements made for staff in parts of the U.S. and Europe. The bank told staff on Thursday it was implementing a staggered work-from-home plan for its New York-area employees after Governor Andrew Cuomo asked businesses to help the state slow the spread of the virus. It has also sent workers in Milan, Seattle, San Francisco and Ohio home in recent days. Friday’s directive applies only to office workers whose jobs allow them to telecommute, according to the memo from the bank’s most senior leaders.
