A rebound in European equities weakened on Friday as the index headed for its worst week since the global financial crisis. Concerns around the coronavirus and the disappointing response from policymakers kept investors on edge. The Stoxx 600 Index was up 1.3% by 8:59 a.m. London time, recovering some ground after yesterday’s 11% slump and rising from a 2013 low. A rally for travel stocks was short-lived, with the sector turning negative to trade 2.8% lower. Among notable movers, Roche Holding AG jumped 3.2% after the Swiss drugmaker won approval from the U.S. government for a highly automated coronavirus test. European stocks saw their worst day ever on Thursday as concerns over the pandemic’s impact on the global economy increased. Action from the European Central Bank, and a U.S. travel ban to combat the outbreak’s spread, failed to calm market nerves. Restrictions on the movement of people and on businesses have further weighed on sentiment. “It’s quite unprecedented in some ways, and in other ways the sell-off is bringing fresh memories of the great financial crisis back,” David Holohan, head of equity strategy at Mediolanum, by phone. Holohan added that what is more unusual is the fact that the selling has been quite broad-based, at a time when investors aren’t worried about the financial system as a whole.
