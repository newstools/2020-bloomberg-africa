The ban also includes those who “come from” these regions, the statement said, without further explanation. The government is also suspending the issuance of visas on arrivals to travelers from all countries. Diplomatic and business travelers are excluded from the travel ban, which will last 30 days, but face health checks and possible quarantines, the statement said. The decision follows Vietnam’s suspension of visa waivers for nine European countries. The Schengen area comprises 26 European countries that allows travel without papers across most of the bloc. Vietnam Airlines announced on its website today that it will not carry passengers on return flights to Vietnam from London, Paris and Frankfurt beginning Sunday. Flights scheduled to depart those cities Saturday will land at Van Don and Can Tho airports, where passengers will be quarantined.
