Spain will impose a nationwide lockdown for two weeks as part of a state of emergency the government is to declare Saturday as coronavirus cases are soaring, El Mundo reported. The lockdown will be implemented from Monday morning and will mean Spaniards will only be allowed to leave their homes under limited circumstances, like going to work or buying groceries, the newspaper said, citing a draft decree that the cabinet of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is set to approve on Saturday. Spain’s diagnosed cases of the novel coronavirus jumped more than 35% to 5,753 on Saturday and the death toll rose to 136, the Health Ministry said. A country of more than 45 million people, it’s the second-most infected nation in Europe after Italy as the epicenter of the virus shifts from Asia to Europe. The lockdown was already being implemented in terms of travel to Spain, the Telegraph newspaper reported. Some planes on their way to vacation spots in the country were forced to turn back mid-flight on Saturday and Jet2 airlines has now canceled its flights to Spain, the newspaper reported.
