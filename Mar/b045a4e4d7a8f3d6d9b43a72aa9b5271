The crowds of anxious travelers were a stark contrast to the increasingly loud calls for people to practice “social distancing” as a way to get ahead of the spread of the coronavirus and buy fragile health care systems time. Illinois Senator Dick Durbin said that some arriving passengers at O’Hare face up to eight hours of delays waiting for luggage, immigration, customs and possible medical screening. President Donald Trump announced a ban on travel from Europe last week, leading many Americans to scramble for flights home. On Saturday, Trump said the U.S. will broaden its temporary travel restrictions to include the U.K. and Ireland, two countries left out of the earlier order. Long lines were also reported at Dallas Fort Worth and Dulles airports.
