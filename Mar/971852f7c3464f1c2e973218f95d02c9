Spain is declaring a state of emergency effective immediately for 15 days, significantly limiting mobility in the country as the government seeks to stop the expansion of the novel coronavirus, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in televised speech Saturday. The Spanish government will take full control of administration nationwide, Sanchez said after a seven-hour cabinet meeting. The state of emergency places severe restrictions on movement and Spaniards will only be allowed to leave their houses for specific circumstances, he said.
