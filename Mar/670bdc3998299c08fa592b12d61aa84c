To whittle down the size of crowds in public spaces and slow down the infection’s spread, Israel will close cafes, theaters and restaurants, Netanyahu said on Saturday. “We can beat the virus,” Netanyahu said. “But it will take a new daily routine.” There have been 193 confirmed cases of the illness in Israel, with four recoveries and no deaths, according to the country’s health ministry. Netanyahu said he plans to use technology that Israel used to fight against terrorism for a “quick and effective” search of patients.

Netanyahu Calls for Emergency Israeli Government to Tackle Virus The government set aside 10 billion shekels ($2.7 billion) for loans to businesses negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Israel’s finance ministry forecasts a significant decline in economic growth, given that tens of thousands of people are now in quarantine, and given the lack of certainty as to when the government will lift the emergency measures.
