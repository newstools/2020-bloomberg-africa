Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on March 13. President Donald Trump told U.S. energy officials to purchase “large amounts” of oil to fill up the nation’s emergency reserve after the biggest price crash in a generation. The idea of replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- as proposed by some oil lobbyists earlier this week in light of the collapse in prices -- would enable the government to take as much as 77 million barrels off the world market. The stockpile, set up after the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, has previously been tapped in response to emergencies, such as Hurricane Katrina. While the reserve has a storage capacity of 713.5 million barrels, it currently comprises 635 million barrels buried in underground salt caverns along the U.S. Gulf Coast. “We’re going to fill it right up to the top -- saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry,” Trump said on Friday. If the government filled the reserve to capacity at today’s prices, the purchase would cost about $2.6 billion and could generate about 430,000 barrels-a-day of demand over approximately six months.Currently the government expects oil supply to exceed demand by about 970,000 barrels a day this year. The U.S. has so far spent about $25.7 billion building the SPR, including $5 billion for facilities and almost the rest for crude. The average cost of the oil has been $29.7 a barrel. Trump said the move to purchase now “puts us in a position that’s very strong, and we’re buying it at the right price.” Crude prices plunged over 20% this week in the worst slump since 2008 after major producers embarked on a war for market share by boosting output just as the coronavirus slams demand. The price crash has put pressure on American shale drillers, several of which have cut capital spending and dividends to bolster their balance sheets. — With assistance by Javier Blas
