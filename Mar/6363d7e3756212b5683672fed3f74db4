The school council, executive and leadership teams had decided to bring term 1 to an early close as a pre-emptive measure, Principal Rebecca Cody said in a letter to families reported by various media. Geelong Grammar is in Victoria state. The government has banned mass gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday and has advised Australians to reconsider all non-essential overseas travel.
