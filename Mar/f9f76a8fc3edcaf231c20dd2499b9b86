A fire burns at Table Mountain national park in Capetown, South Africa on March 15. Source: South African National Parks Source: South African National Parks A fire raging on the slopes of Cape Town’s Table Mountain prompted evacuations in some of the city’s most expensive residential areas as a strong wind fanned the flames and prevented the use of helicopters to battle the blaze. Residents in the suburbs of Higgovale, and Clifton, where a property on Nettleton Road was recently listed at more than $10 million, fled as the fire that started shortly before 1 p.m. local time Sunday approached their houses. Several homes were damaged by the blaze and a number of cars destroyed as the wind drove the flames from the area below the city’s iconic Table Mountain Aerial Cableway over Signal Hill to the exclusive beachside suburb of Clifton. The fire had yet to be contained as of 9 p.m. The city said 30 fire-fighting appliances were battling the blaze, along with more than 200 firefighters. — With assistance by Paul Vecchiatto
