The Nigerian central bank said market fundamental don’t support a devaluation of its naira currency at this time despite the reduction in capital inflows caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The bank will launch an investigation along with other agencies to uncover “unscrupulous” currency traders creating panic with rumors of a devaluation, the bank said in a statement late Thursday sent by its spokesman Isaac Okorafor. “The size of Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves remains robust and comfortable,” the bank said. “As such, the CBN remains able and willing to meet all genuine demand for foreign exchange for legitimate transactions.” The collapse of oil prices this week after major producers disagreed on output cuts to battle lower demand caused by the virus outbreak has raised pressure on the currency of Africa’s top oil producer. The central bank could be forced to mark down the naira during the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts and investors released Thursday. Although the naira has slid to its weakest since August 2017, when it was last devalued, it has traded in a narrow range in that period under the management of the central bank.
