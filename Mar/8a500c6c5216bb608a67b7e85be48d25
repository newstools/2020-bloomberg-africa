Italy’s government is weighing a new package of measures including increased spending for its stricken health-care sector and moves to cover extraordinary redundancies caused by the coronavirus, according to a draft decree seen by Bloomberg. The draft, which is subject to change before approval, foresees: The decree also allows companies to hold annual general meetings virtually for a period running into the summer. Measures also include a package of loan guarantees to avoid a credit crunch. A state guarantee fund for small and medium enterprises will be boosted by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti will be allowed to guarantee at least 10 billion euros in loans through a 500 million-euro Treasury fund. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s cabinet is seeking agreement on the plan a day after unions and business representatives signed an accord to protect workers in a bid to keep at least some production up and running. Conte’s office declined to comment. Earlier this week, the government said it’s ready to spend as much as 25 billion euros on stimulus measures to aid an economy hit by a nationwide lockdown. Italy has the world’s second-highest number of diagnosed cases of coronavirus, with more than 15,000 known infections and more than 1,000 deaths. — With assistance by John Follain
