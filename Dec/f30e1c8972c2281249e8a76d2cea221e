Yellen vowed to “build our economy back better than before” -- echoing President-elect Joe Biden’s campaign theme -- with a focus on addressing widening economic inequities that she called an “American tragedy” that must be urgently tackled. She made the remarks Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, after Biden introduced the ex-Federal Reserve chair as the leader of his economic team as the Treasury secretary-nominee. If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen would also have a role in foreign policy and national security interests through the agency’s sanctions portfolios. She said she hopes to work with Biden’s foreign policy team to “help restore America’s global leadership.”
