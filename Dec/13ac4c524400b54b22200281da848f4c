Citigroup Inc. reorganized its equities division as the bank seeks to move up the league-table rankings for stock trading. Julia Raiskin will lead the equities-sales efforts in the Asia-Pacific region, Dirk Keijer will have a similar role for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Cedric Pauwels will be in charge of those efforts for the Americas, according to a company memo. Antonin Jullier will leave his post as global head of equity sales to explore other opportunities. The moves are meant to help the bank become a top-four competitor in equities trading within two to three years, according to the memo from Fater Belbachir, who joined Citigroup from Barclays Plc earlier this year to lead the global equities-trading operation. “I have spent a significant amount of time with many of you over the last few months since I joined Citi. The engagement and enthusiasm to drive the equities franchise forward was evident in all discussions,” Belbachir said in the memo. “Delivering the firm and platform in a client-centric model is going to be critical for our success.” — With assistance by Keith Campbell
