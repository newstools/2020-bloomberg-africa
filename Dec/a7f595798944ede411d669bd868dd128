After starting an organization in 2018 to bring women together to socialize, they formed the Feminist Coalition in July to champion equality in Nigeria. By October the 13-member group, which includes journalists, activists, lawyers, and creatives, had thrown its support behind a long-running call to disband a national police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, with a history of abuse. SARS was disbanded, but peaceful  protests demanding reforms were met with government crackdowns that left more than 50 dead. As the protests gained steam, the coalition used social media to mobilize 600Â lawyers to give legal aid to the hundreds arrested.
