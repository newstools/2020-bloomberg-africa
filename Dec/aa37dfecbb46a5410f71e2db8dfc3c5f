A pact between labor unions, business groups and the government in South Africa to find ways of reducing the debt of the stricken national power utility will be endorsed tomorrow. It will be signed at a meeting of the National Economic Development and Labour Council, said Matthew Parks, parliamentary coordinator for the Congress of South African Trade Unions. The agreement, or social compact, on Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. was first proposed by Cosatu, South Africaâ€™s biggest labor group, late last year. Its planned signing was reported earlier by Business Day newspaper.
