The only people allowed in the room were the two cameramen and one other member of the crew and “suitable PPE” was worn. The first Christmas broadcast was delivered by King George V in 1932 and it has become an important part of the festive season for many in Britain and across the Commonwealth. The Queen did not make a Christmas broadcast in 1969 because a repeat of the documentary “Royal Family” was already scheduled for the holiday period.
