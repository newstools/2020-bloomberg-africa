Militants arrived on Friday night before opening fire and entering the boys’ school in the town of Kankara, said Garba Shehu, a spokesman for President Muhammadu Buhari. The head of state urged Nigerian security forces to “go after the attackers” to recover the students and make sure they are safe, Shehu said in a statement on Saturday. The attack took place in Katsina state, the home region of Buhari whose administration is struggling to contain widespread insecurity across swathes of northern and central Nigeria. The president arrived in Katsina for a private visit on the same day the school was invaded. While Shehu didn’t reveal how many students were abducted, he said hundreds of boys were sent “fleeing and scrambling over perimeter walls” by the shooting.
