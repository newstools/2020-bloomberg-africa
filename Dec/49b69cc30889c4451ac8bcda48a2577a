Nigerian inflation quickened to an almost three-year high in November as dollar shortages, insecurity in farming areas and supply bottlenecks stoked food prices. Consumer prices rose 14.9% from a year earlier, compared with 14.2% in October, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday in a report published on its website. That matched the median estimate of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Costs increased 1.6% in the month. â€” With assistance by Simbarashe Gumbo, and Anthony Osae-Brown
