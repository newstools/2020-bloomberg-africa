The biggest vaccination effort in history has begun. This week, the U.K. was first to clear the use of a new shot from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which the companies say stops 95% of Covid-19 infections. The U.S. will likely do the same, and a separate vaccine from Moderna Inc. is close behind. By the end of 2020, tens of millions of people around the globe are expected to have been inoculated against the coronavirus. Next year, it will be billions more. For the latest on the vaccine rollout,  click here. Bloomberg is tracking nine of the most promising vaccines around the globe, from national procurement deals to shots in patients’ arms. By our count, more than one million people have been vaccinated and more than 7.85 billion doses have already been allotted. That’s enough doses to cover half the world’s population—if they were distributed evenly. That, however, isn’t likely. Richer countries have hedged their bets with extensive supply deals, and some of the vaccines are inherently difficult to deliver to far-flung places. Some countries have struck their own paths. China and Russia got a head start by authorizing their vaccines in July before they’d even been tested. Including those, a total of five vaccines are now available, in limited quantities, in three countries. As vaccine approval and rollout evolves, we’ll be following the progress and building new tools to better understand the data.
