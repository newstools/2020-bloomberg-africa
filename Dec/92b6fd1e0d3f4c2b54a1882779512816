Colonel Malick Diaw was chosen Saturday at the council’s inaugural session in the capital, Bamako. The former No. 2 in the Aug. 18 junta received 111 out of 118 votes, Radio France Internationale reported. There were no other candidates. The election of a military man to head the interim government is sure to fuel worries in some quarters about the council’s commitment to eventually handing over power to a civilian government. The council -- made up of political parties, members of civil society and the military -- will play the role of the national assembly before new elections are organized. The Economic Community of West African States has imposed an 18-month deadline for holding elections for a new president and parliament. Earlier this week, multiple Grammy-nominated Malian singer-songwriter Salif Keita announced his entry into politics as a member of the transitional council.
