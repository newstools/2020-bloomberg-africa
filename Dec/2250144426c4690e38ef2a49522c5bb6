Tesla Inc.’s legal headache in Germany is growing more painful after a court ordered the carmaker to halt logging at a construction site, raising the risk of delays to Elon Musk’s first electric-car factory in Europe. For the second time this week, a court told Tesla to stop chopping down trees on the land where the plant will be built. The latest decision on Thursday by the higher administrative court in Berlin overturned a lower-court ruling just hours earlier that had allowed cutting to resume. The temporary halt to land clearing is meant to give the court time to examine claims by two environmental groups that the U.S. company isn’t doing enough to protect local lizards and snakes. A final ruling may come in a few days, Christiane Scheerhorn, a spokeswoman for the court, said by phone. Any major delays would be bad news for Tesla, which is on an ambitious timetable to have the plant up and running by the middle of next year. The company plans to eventually produce as many as 500,000 cars annually at the site, posing a serious challenge to German rivals Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG. The lower court had decided that the main populations of both species -- namely sand lizards and smooth snakes -- live outside the project area, and that the company took sufficient precautions to ensure their survival. It had also ordered Tesla to stop cutting pine trees on the 83-hectare (205 acres) plot for the few days it took to consider the complaint by the environmental groups. Tesla is clearing the land for stockpiling and the installation of pipelines needed for construction of the factory, local authorities said last month when approving the works. — With assistance by Brian Parkin, and Karin Matussek
