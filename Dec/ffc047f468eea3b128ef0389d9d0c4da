After announcing in 2018 he had retired from recording, he’s become an increasingly vocal critic of Mali’s efforts to end an Islamist insurgency and of France’s involvement in the conflict. France has a large military presence in West Africa, with more than 5,000 troops carrying out counter-insurgency operations in Mali and the wider Sahel, a semi-arid zone on the southern fringe of the Sahara desert. Keita will serve on the 121-member transitional council for 18 months, alongside members of the military junta, former militants and an influential religious leader. The Economic Community of West African States demands that elections be held in 2022 to name a new president and parliament.
