U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Britain should prepare to leave the European Union’s single market without a trade deal as negotiations with the bloc falter. “There’s now the strong possibility we will have a solution that’s much more like an Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,” Johnson said in a pooled TV interview on Thursday. “We’re not stopping the talks, we’ll continue to negotiate. But looking at where we are, I do think it’s vital that everybody now gets ready for that Australian option.” Johnson blamed the EU for his gloomy assessment, saying the bloc had resurrected its demands that the U.K. should be bound by future changes in its rules. He said the plan “basically means that whatever new laws they brought in, we would have to follow or else face punishment.” “Clearly that’s not a sensible way to proceed,” Johnson said. “It’s unlike any other free trade deal.” The pound extended its decline following Johnson’s comments but remained within its range from earlier in the day. It was down around 0.9% at $1.3284.
