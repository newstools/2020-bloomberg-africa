The pound rallied to its strongest level this year buoyed by a broadly weaker U.S. dollar. Sterling rose as much as 0.9% to $1.3486, pushing beyond a high touched in early September to reach the strongest since December 2019. The Bloomberg Dollar Index fell for a third day to the weakest since April 2018. Hopes that the EU and U.K. can reach a deal as the Dec. 31 deadline nears have also contributed to the poundâ€™s advance. The currency has rallied about 9% against the greenback since June, with traders taking cues from over four years of Brexit drama to conclude a last minute resolution is likely.
