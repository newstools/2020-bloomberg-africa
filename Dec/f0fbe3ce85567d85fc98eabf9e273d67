U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will go ahead with plans to ease coronavirus restrictions over Christmas despite mounting pressure to stop people mixing indoors over the holiday. As many as three households will still be able to gather together for five days between Dec. 23 and 27 in England, a person familiar with the matter said. But the government is expected to set out stronger guidance to people on how to keep elderly relatives safe. This could include asking people to self-isolate before joining with other households, according to the Daily Telegraph. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will meet with his counterparts from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Wednesday to try and agree a common approach across the U.K., after talks failed to reach a united position on Tuesday. Johnson has faced growing demands to rethink his approach over Christmas after a surge in Covid-19 infections in recent days, particularly in London and southeast England. The U.K. capital will be placed in the highest tier of restrictions from Wednesday, with pubs and restaurants forced to close. In a rare joint editorial Tuesday, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal said the government’s relaxation of social distancing rules over the holiday period will increase infections and risk putting further strain on hospitals. Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the plans. He told Johnson in a letter that the government had “lost control of infections,” putting the economy and National Health Service at “grave risk” in the new year. The British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said allowing people to mix at Christmas was a “recipe for catastrophe.” Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair of council, said: “We agree that the impact on the NHS of the almost inevitable third wave of the infection in the new year will be disastrous.”
