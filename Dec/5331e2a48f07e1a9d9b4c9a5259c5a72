The Greater Los Angeles area reported another record day of coronavirus cases Friday, with infections surpassing 500,000 in what health officials say is a “Thanksgiving surge.” The data, coming two weeks after millions traveled across the country for the Thanksgiving break, showed that one in 20 people in the most populous U.S. county had been infected by the virus. The number of total cases increased by 13,815 to 501,635. The county, home to the highest number of infections and fatalities in the U.S., also reported 50 new deaths, bringing the total to 8,199. “These numbers are overwhelming,” Barbara Ferrer, the county’s director of public health, said in a statement. “The impact of the Thanksgiving surge of cases on top of already rising cases is creating extraordinary stress on our health-care system. When we see increases in cases, we see increases in hospitalizations about two weeks later.” Should we have another surge related to winter holidays, the numbers of hospitalizations and patients in the ICU could become catastrophic.
