New Zealand officials will work to implement quarantine-free access for visitors from the Cook Islands while final preparations are made for two-way travel, the statement said. The Cook Islands remains free of Covid-19, it said. This will be the first reciprocal travel bubble New Zealand has formed after closing its borders earlier this year to eliminate local Covid-19 transmission. While New Zealand nationals can visit Australia quarantine-free, a two-way bubble has been delayed due to Australia’s higher tolerance for community transmission. Currently, anyone entering New Zealand must go into quarantine for two weeks in a government-run isolation facility.
