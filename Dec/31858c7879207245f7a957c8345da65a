Denmark plans to announce a partial lockdown of its biggest cities, including the capital Copenhagen, after a record spike in coronavirus cases over the weekend. “We are targeting the areas where the disease is most widespread,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late on Sunday in a video on her Facebook page.
