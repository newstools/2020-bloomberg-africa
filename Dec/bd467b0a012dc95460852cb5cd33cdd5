Source: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Source: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Iran has executed a journalist accused of promoting anti-government protests that spread across the country in late 2017, state television reported. Rouhollah Zam was put to death early Saturday after a judicial court upheld his sentence and denied his appeal, according to the report. The TV channel described him as the head of anti-revolutionary networks and he was convicted of “corruption on earth,” an offense that carried the death penalty. Zam was arrested in October 2019 after returning to Iran. He was running a popular Persian-language news channel on the messaging platform Telegram from his home in France when the protests broke out. He made a number of appearances on dissident Iranian satellite channels in which he was critical of the Islamic Republic.
