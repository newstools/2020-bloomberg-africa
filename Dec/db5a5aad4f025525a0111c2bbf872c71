The European Union will publish contingency measures this week to keep flights in the air and trucks on the road if it fails to reach a trade agreement with the U.K., according to officials with knowledge of the plans.

The bloc will also propose the creation of a legal framework to allow British and EU fishing boats to enjoy continued access to each other’s waters for 12 months after the end of the transition period on Dec. 31, or until the bloc has signed a fisheries agreement with the U.K. A fourth measure covers aviation safety certificates to allow the continued use of certain products in EU planes so the aircraft aren’t grounded. The four proposals come on top of an earlier move covering rail connections through the Channel Tunnel which was agreed last month. The bloc is also preparing to launch a 5 billion-euro ($6 billion) fund to help those states and industries most affected by Brexit.
