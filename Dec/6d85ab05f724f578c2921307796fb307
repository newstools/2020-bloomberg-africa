The five-year investment will reduce the price of a Heineken to 1,500 Congolese francs ($0.77) from 2,300 francs, Bralima said in an e-mailed statement on Thursday. The Kinshasa-based company will produce reusable bottles locally at its Bouteillerie de Kinshasa Sarl facility, it said. “The local production of Heineken marks an important step in the development of the brewing industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo,” Bralima’s director, Victor Madiela, said. After several years of reduced investments amid political uncertainty, Heineken’s growth was “particularly strong” in Congo in 2019, according to its annual report. Bralima has operated in Congo since 1923 and is one of the country’s largest producers and distributors of beer and carbonated drinks. Heineken owns about 95% of Bralima and has been the company’s majority shareholder since 1987. Congo’s population is about 87 million people, according to the World Bank.
