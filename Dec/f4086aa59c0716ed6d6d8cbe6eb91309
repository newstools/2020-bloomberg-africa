The Ivorian government issued two passports, an ordinary one and a diplomatic document, to Gbagbo, who’s been living in Belgium for nearly two years, his lawyer Habiba Toure said in an emailed statement Friday. The issuances come a month after an Oct. 31 presidential election which Gbagbo sought to contest. His candidacy was rejected over a criminal conviction, authorities said at the time.

Those efforts will likely seek to ensure that a 20-year prison sentence handed to him last year, after he was found guilty of looting a bank a decade ago, isn’t enforced. He has denied any wrongdoing. The party eagerly awaits Gbagbo’s return “to participate in the reconciliation strongly hoped for by Ivorians,” it said in a separate statement. Gbagbo hasn’t been in Ivory Coast since his acquittal by the Hague’s International Criminal Court of separate charges linked to a post-election conflict. The former leader triggered a five-month civil war when he refused to concede defeat to President Alassane Ouattara in 2010 elections. Ouattara, who went on to run the country for 10 years, won another five-year mandate in the October vote that the main opposition parties boycotted.
